Regarding the rebates, the benefits accruing to the automobile industry consist ofcustom rebates(i.e. Rebate Items 317.04 and 460.17) of Schedules Numbers 3 and 4 respectively, andrefunds(i.e. Items 536.00; 537.00 and 538.00) in Schedule 5 of the relevant customs duties in Chapters 87 and 98 of Part 1 of Schedule No. 1 to the Customs and Excise Act No. 91 of 1964. The ITAC issues Production Rebate Certificates (PRCs) to qualifying final manufacturers of eligible products (i.e., vehicles, components, and automotive tooling), which indicate the amount of customs duty that can be rebated on imports into South Africa.

The key objective of the revised SA Connect model is to achieve 100% broadband access for all communities and Government facilities. The programme aims to connect South Africans within 36 months (2023/24 – 2025/26) at a minimum speed of 5 Megabits per second (Mbps) for households and 10 Mbps for Government facilities, including public schools and health facilities. The revised SA Connect model, which is currently being implemented, comprises the following key interventions: I. To date, SITA has provided broadband connectivity to 6 247 Government sites. II..Through the 2021 spectrum auction and in support of the SA Connect Policy, the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) awarded spectrum to Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) to increase their network coverage and quality of services. The successful MNOs were obligated to increase their network coverageby starting in all under-served areas before proceeding to major cities and towns in the country. These obligations must be achieved by 31 July 2029. Furthermore, licensees are obliged to connect 16139 schools, 4232 health facilities, 570 libraries and 937 traditional offices. III. To date, Sentech and BBI have deployed around 6 557 Wi-Fi hotspots nationally.Lower data prices are offered to citizens where the SA Connect programme has been implemented. Furthermore, the connectivity that will be provided to schools, health facilities, traditional authorities and libraries by licensees as part of their social obligations will be zero-rated',\n",

Regarding the awareness campaign, free-to-air broadcasters, including community broadcasters, were appointed by USAASA after Service Level Agreements (SLA) were concluded. Thereafter various awareness campaigns were rolled out on radio and television. The SABC also appointed an agency to elevate consumer awareness through:Television Commercials (advert and squeeze backs); Outdoor Campaigns (billboards, murals, taxi advertising); Digital Campaigns (taxi rank digital screens and paid social media advertising); Radio Campaigns (live reads, recorded adverts and outdoor broadcasts at select events); and, Events (community and shopping mall activations). These campaigns are underway across targeted provinces. The DCDT BDM Project Management Office monitors progress on a weekly basis.

       "  'answer': 'I have been advised by the Department as follows: - The Department of Communications and Digital Technologies (DCDT) plays a crucial role in South Africa’s digital transformation and is committed to empowering citizens with the requisite skills as well as address the digital skills gap. To this end, the Department developed the National Digital and Future Skills Strategy which was approved by Cabinet in August 2020.This strategy provides a framework for the prioritisation of critical digital and future skills as well as ensures coordinated and integrated implementation across Government and various sectors. The strategy was developed to, among others, ensure that citizens and especially the youth acquire new digital skills to adapt to the changing roles and responsibilities brought upon by the use of new technologies. It further highlights the importance of rolling out a large-scale digital literacy programmes to focus on building digital competence in information, media and data literacy, communication and collaboration, digital content creation, safety, devices and software operations, problem solving, and career as well as entrepreneurship-related information and knowledge. The strategy also calls for the digital literacy programme to include cyber awareness and security conduct.The DCDT is facilitating the implementation of the Digital and Future Skills Strategy through a comprehensive 5-year implementation programme which outlines all actions and initiatives. The programme sets out clear outputs and deliverables as well as the stakeholders responsible. As recommended by the Presidential Commission on the Fourth Industrial Revolution (PC4IR), the programme seeks to ensure that investment is made to produce a strong science, technology, engineering, arts, mathematics, innovation and entrepreneurship (STEAMIE) foundation for digital and future skills in the basic education and post-school education phases. It also seeks to ensure that there is equitable access to foundational STEAMIE skills for women and girls, persons with disabilities, and Young People Not in Education, Employment and Training (NEET).The Department’s contribution has led to the integration of digital skills into the Department of Basic Education’s Professional Development Framework for Educators. This provides guidelines for the professional development of educators who “use ICTs to enhance teaching and learning”.The Digital and Future Skills Strategy advocates for a coordinated and integrated rollout across Government and various sectors. To achieve this, the Ministry of Communications and Digital Technologies established the Digital Skills Forum (DSF) as a Government-led mechanism that will provide strategic direction to its implementation. The structure is also responsible for prioritising and coordinating areas of focus, mobilising resources in the form of expertise, funding and institutional support, as well as to monitor performance. The composition of the DSF includes Government departments and entities, academia, business, civil society and youth formations.Due to the major investments required to successfully deploy digital skills in the country, the Digital and Future Skills Strategy is being implemented in collaboration with Government entities, business, civil society, academia as well as the public including youth fraternities. The funding of digital skills programmes is a challenge and the DCDT is continuing to reach out to potential investors and partners. The DCDT partnerships include the following:-Partnership with British High Commission - The DCDT has partnered with the British High Commission (BHC) and the South African Local Government Association (SALGA) to pilot training on broadband and digital skills for municipal managers and councillors. It was launched by the Minister of Communications and Digital Technologies in the Limpopo province on 3 September 2024 and is scheduled to be rolled out in the North West and KwaZulu-Natal provinces later this year. Its intention is to capacitate councillors and municipal managers with skills on cybersecurity, data analytics as well as robotics.Partnership in GIZ-South Africa - The DCDT continues its participation in the GIZ-South Africa programme which is a collaboration with the skills development agency of the German Government. The aim is to implement the Digital Skills for Jobs and Income (DS4JI) project wherein 2000 Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET) students and Young People Not in Education, Employment and Training (YNEET) will be trained in cybersecurity, cloud computing, software development, data analysis, and content development and multimedia. At least 80% will be placed in jobs within a 3-year period.The following planned activities will be undertaken by the DCDT to build a digital society in which people can adopt and adapt to the emerging digital technologies:a.Development of a digital skilling pilot programme, including broad-based digital literacy, empowering citizens to participate in the digital society effectively while limiting risk, privacy intrusions and cybercrime. Digital literacy will be integrated into the training component of public employment and youth service programmes. Pre-entry level digital skills development programmes will be developed to include skills in analytics, cybersecurity, cloud and Internet of Things (IoT). b.The DCDT will collaborate with industry partners to develop a national digital skills development platform inclusive of all South African languages and catering for people with disabilities. This will include the establishment of a data-driven ‘platform of platforms’ to link and enable data-sharing across several existing databases and information systems within the skills development ecosystem. It will also aim to unlock digital learning and skills building opportunities to promote increased access to the labour market by Young People Not in Education, Employment and Training (YNEET). It will further enable secure data-sharing across multiple databases and training development ecosystems. c.The Department will collaborate with academia, industry as well as key Government Departments to build digital leadership skills. The key Government Departments will include the National School of Government (NSG), Department of Higher Education and Training (DHET) and Department of Basic Education (DBE). The DCDT will ensure there is leadership in the operationalisation of the Digital Skills Forum to coordinate the implementation of digital skills development. It will facilitate access to digital skills by building opportunities in public employment programmes and youth and community services. It will also steer investment and opportunities towards digital skills development. d.The Department will utilise the SA Post Office and community infrastructure for digital skills training and development. The activities will include the development of business cases, approval of digital skills concepts, acquiring funding, appointment of service providers, as well as conducting proof of concepts. It will also see the training of SAPO staff, the rollout of digital infrastructure as well as the national programme.',\n",

NW1094E',\n",
       "  'answer': \"1. South Africa does not have a regime of high interest rates. The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) has the constitutional responsibility to maintain low and stable inflation consistent with the inflation target. This mandate is fulfilled through the inflation targeting framework under which the SARB uses the benchmark interest rate to stabilise prices at the 4.5 per cent midpoint target, which is the nominal anchor for general prices in the economy. Tolerating high inflation does not reduce interest rates. Lender’s factor higher inflation and inflation risk premia, which increases borrowing costs in the medium to long-run even if the policy rate remains low. The high cost of high inflation in 2022 led to many protests globally. The inflation targeting framework is the most appropriate framework to achieve price stability as such there are no plans to abandon this policy framework. South Africa achieved price stability with lower policy rate increases compared to other emerging and advanced markets during the recent inflationary surge. Furthermore, Economic Policy division at the National Treasury advises the finance minister on economic policy matters including those related to monetary policy. The division conducts regular reviews and draws on the local and international literature and experience. All of South Africa's trading partners use the same framework to control inflation. 2. The inflation targeting framework has proven to be the most effective and practical framework for achieving price stability which is why it has been adopted by many advanced and emerging market economies including Chile, India, Brazil, Australia and the Eurozone. The framework and the choice of target is based on continuous analysis, reviews and global experience. Part of the framework’s success is its core pillar of publicly announcing and committing to a nominal target as a monetary policy objective to help anchor all prices of goods and services at that target, in our case 4.5 per cent, thereby keeping prices low and stable. Furthermore, interest rate decisions by the SARB’s monetary policy committee are informed by data.\",\n",

       "  'answer': 'a) The Public Procurement Act, 2024 (Act No. 28 of 2024) was assented to by the President and published as an Act in the GovernmentGazetteon 23 July 2024. It is important to note that the provisions of the Act are not in force yet. The President will bring the provisions of the Act into operation through a proclamation in theGazette. Section 69 of the Act enables the President to bring the provisions into operation on different dates (phased approach) and to determine different dates for different categories of procuring institutions such as national and provincial departments, national and provincial public entities and municipalities and municipal entities. The Act also allows for the repeal or amendment of different provisions of a law to be brought into operation on different dates. For example, the repeal of the Preferential Policy Procurement Framework Act, 2000 (PPPFA), and Chapter 4 of the Act (including provisions of other Chapters necessary for its implementation) and required regulations should take effect on the same date. Many provisions of the Act require regulations before the accompanying provisions of the Act could be brought into operation. The process of making regulations involves consultation with affected Ministers, SALGA, and the public and Parliamentary scrutiny as outlined in section 64 of the Act. Different regulations for different categories of procuring institutions and for different types of procurement are provided in section 64. The making of regulations regarding procurement of infrastructure and capital assets, and goods and services related to infrastructure and capital assets, are a mandatory requirement. The recommendations on the effective dates of various provisions of the Act and the accompanying regulations will consider the readiness of the affected procuring institutions to implement. The current procurement framework provided for under the Public Finance Management Act, 1999, the Municipal Finance Management Act, 2003, the PPPFA and other applicable legislation, remain in place until the relevant provisions of the Public Procurement Act, 2024, and accompanying regulations take effect. The National Treasury is currently inducting government institutions on the Act as part of the consultation process. Due to the interest in this Act and as expressed during the parliamentary process, Parliament directed National Treasury to consult broadly and consider involving many external stakeholders in the development of the regulations. b) There is no impact because the Act is not in operation yet.',\n",

I am informed as follows: (a)(i) The rationalisation of Universal Service and Access Agency of South Africa (USAASA) and Universal Service and Access Fund (USAF) is dependent on legislative enablement. The establishment of the Digital Development Challenge Fund (DDCF) must be preceded by an amendment of the Electronic Communications Act, 2005 that sets the basis for the disestablishment of the USAASA and the repurposing and renaming of the USAF to the DDCF. Some delays were experienced because of further consultation required with National Treasury on the most appropriate institutional form for the planned DDCF. (a)(ii) The institutional form has now been agreed and the relevant draft legislation, the Electronic Communications Amendment Bill (DDCF) was finalised and approved by the Economic Sectors, Investment, Employment and Infrastructure Development (ESIEID) Directors-General Cluster. Cabinet needs to approve before the public consultations can begin. An interdepartmental team has been put in place and a draft disestablishment plan has been prepared. (a)(iii) USAASA must manage the USAF in accordance with its mandate to promote the goal of universal access and universal service. USAASA is prioritising Broadcasting Digital Migration and the Broadband projects. The current balance in USAF is R2 979 838 513.69 and is held in short term deposits in USAF. The balance result from allocations from National Treasury that were earmarked for Broadcasting Digital Migration and Broadband projects. (b) The USAF is currently a Schedule 3A public entity under the PFMA. The Department intends to disestablish and delist USAASA and repurpose and capacitate the USAF as the DDCF. The Schedule 3A public entity and therefore the legal entity remains the same. USAASA’s statutory policy and research functions would be transferred to the Department. Existing USAASA implementing agency projects such as those in the Broadcasting Digital Migration and Broadband will be shifted to other Departmental entities to ensure rational consolidation. The funds currently held in short term deposits in USAF are earmarked for Broadcasting Digital Migration and Broadband in accordance with National Treasury allocations and will be expended accordingly. If there are unutilised funds by the time of the disestablishment of USAASA, permission will be sought from NT in terms of s53(3) of the PFMA to retain the funds for the DDCF. The current South African fiscal constraint reality will need to be carefully managed during the transformation process. It has been made clear that there will be no additional new funding for the DDCF activities and the DDCF will need to operate along the projected MTEF allocations of USAASA and USAF in the short to medium term.',\n",

NW922E',\n",
       "  'answer': 'I am advised by ITAC of the following. Background: The genesis of reciprocal commitments by firms in tariff amendment investigations is a 21 April 2016 Trade Policy Directive (‘the Directive’) from the then Minister of Economic Development [now the Minister of Trade, Industry and Competition (the dtic)], issued to ITAC in terms of section 5 of the Act. The Directive, read with the 2021 Trade Policy for Industrial Development and Employment Growth framework, is aimed at ensuring that ‘tariff support (does) not blunt competitive pressures on firms’; and such measures ought to be building firm level capabilities, competitiveness and aligning firm level to national interests. A series of measures and commitments made by firms have yielded recognisable gains in production, employment, investment, pricing and exports. The basic idea behind reciprocal commitments is straightforward. Duties are ‘economic rents’ that firms apply for, to which they are not entitled nor ought to claim a right to. These rents, while they have a targeted firm benefit, visit a ‘diffuse set of costs’ across different economic actors. As such, those who receive the benefit are ‘encouraged’ to reciprocate (or align their private benefit with the national interest) through increased production, investment and employment. Not just in their own self-interest, but also in the interests of society. That is, companies make reciprocal commitments based on their financial and market position, existing expansion plans and projected demand growth. a) ITAC welcomes the scrutiny of interested members of the South African public. It is important. It keeps us honest and ensures that we continue to discharge our obligations with the greatest sense of duty, professional regard and care. However, due to the highly sensitive commercial nature of the data disclosed by companies in these reciprocal commitments, which may include investment levels and plans, production costs and other sensitive business information, ITAC is compelled by Section 33(1) of the ITA Act, Act No. 71 of 2002, to not disclose confidential information. Section 33(1) reads as follows: “33.Right of informants to claim confidentiality (1) A person may, when submitting information to the Commission, identify information that the person claims to be information that- (a) is confidential by its nature; or (b) the person otherwise wishes to be recognised as confidential”. b) Published investigations, which are “in process”, where reciprocal commitments form part of the investigation, are listed below: Applicant & request Product & Tariffs concerned STI Electrical (Pty)Ltd Transformer core Request: Increase (From 5% to 15% - WTO bound rate) 8504.90 Peninsula Drums (Pty) Ltd Steel drums Request: Increase (From free of duty to the WTO of 15%) 7310.10.90 Lumax Energy (Pty) Ltd Complete Tracker Request: Increase 8479.89 (From free of duty to the WTO bound rate of 10%; and free of duty to the WTO bound rate of 30%) MCFI INTERNATIONAL (PTY) LTD Aluminium Chlorohydrate (ACH) Request: Increase 2827.32 (From free of duty to 10%) AMRAS a division of ArcelorMittal South Africa Ltd Rails Request: Increase (From 5% to 10%) 7302.10 Ministerial directive Frozen mixed vegetables Request: Review tariff structure 0710.90 Unilever Palm oils and not its fractions, (Refined, Request: Two Rebates bleached) and (Hydrogenated), for use in the manufacture of soaps 1511.90.90 & 1516.20.90 Defy Appliances (Pty) Ltd Cooker hoods for household use Request: Rebate 8414.60.20 Guth South Africa (Pty) Ltd Stainless-steel tubes Request: Rebate 7306.40 c) For reasons as set out in (a) above, these cannot be provided. d) As indicated above, reciprocal commitments are made as part of a tariff amendment application submitted.

       "  'answer': 'Currently Agricultural Sciences does not exist as a separate subject in the Foundation, Intermediate or Senior Phase. However, learners do study plant and animals in Life Skills which is a subject in Grade R-3. Learners study basic content in dairy, meat and wool farming. Furthermore, they study the importance of plants and domestic animals to human life. They study basic skills of planting crops and nurturing and caring for plants and animals. In the Intermediate and Senior Phase, our learners study the knowledge are Life and Living which forms part of the Natural Sciences curriculum in the Intermediate and Interphase. Our learners study plant and animal ecosystems and study farming skills as part of their practical work. Our learners are also exposed to animal handling structures in the Natural Sciences. In 2017, the Department of Basic Education developed the three streams curriculum model. One of the subjects that formed part of this model is Agricultural Studies which forms part of the curriculum for Grades 8 and 9 in the Basic Education sector. The Curriculum and Assessment Policy statements (CAPS) for Agricultural Studies for Grades 8 and 9 have been developed and finalised for implementation in all schools in 2024.In 2022, Umalusi approved the Agricultural Studies CAPS for Grades 8 and 9.

       "  'answer': 'The officials of the Department of International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO) at the South African Embassy in Tunis, received, processed and issued 100 study Visas in April 2024. At the time of application for visas, it was determined by the South African Embassy that all required necessary documentation was submitted, which subsequently led to the issuance of the visas. However, it has been established that the representations made to the Embassy did not align with the stated purpose of their visit to South Africa, hence the Department of Home Affairs decided to revoke their Visas as they violated the Immigration Act of South Africa. As we are all aware, on 26 July 2024, the South African Police Services conducted a raid at the training facility in Mpumalanga Province and confirmed that ninety-five (95) Libyan Nationals were arrested, detained and subsequently deported.',\n",

However, the GCIS has a Language Services unit that was established in April 2008 and a Language Policy that seeks to promote multilingualism to ensure effective and efficient communication between government and the public, in accordance with the objectives of the UOLA of 2012 and the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa. Due to limited financial resources, where necessary and practicable, the department considers the usage, practicality, resources, regional circumstances and the balance of the needs and preferences of the public it serves when deciding on the official language(s) to be used. GCIS further provides translation services for its products and even have a brille digital Vukuzenzele newspaper. The GCIS, in collaboration with The Presidency, currently provides a SASL interpreting service for post-Cabinet media briefings and this service will soon be expanded to cover other communication events.

       "  'answer': '(1) The Department of Justice and Constitutional Development (the Department) is in the process of conducting an extensive review of the Regulation of Interception of Communications and Provision of Communication-related Information Act, 2002 (Act 70 of 2002 (RICA Act) for its comprehensive reform, which considers, among others, its implementation and effectiveness across the various sectors it traverses, which include interception and surveillance law, criminal law, SIM card regulation, communications law, privacy rights and related law. The purpose of this reform project is to review, reform and amend aspects of RICA to enhance its effectiveness, to address legislative gaps and to respond to operational challenges identified by the primary users of RICA. The reform effort began in the processing of the RICA Amendment Bill, 2023 (Bill), in Parliament last year, and continued through the structures established for the processing of the Bill. As part of the processing of the Bill, the JCPS Cluster required the formation of a Task Team, comprising key departments, to discuss the Bill and agree on key positions. Regarding the metrics the Department is measuring, as part of the RICA reform, this is based on research on major thematic areas obtained from key stakeholders. This research was based consultation with internal stakeholders (comments received and multiple engagements with the RICA Task Team), external stakeholders (public comments received on RICA and the Bill) and as identified by the Department as part of its own research and global review of RICA. Some of these include SIM card regulation, judicial oversight mechanisms, bulk surveillance, listed equipment and process flows for listed equipment exemption applications. The Department considered, among others, the comments of stakeholders, based on their operational experience; the existing domestic legislative framework for each of the varying areas of law implicated by RICA; comparative foreign law and international law on similar legislation and its challenges and solutions; domestic news articles and reports on the operational and legislative challenges and proposed solutions for RICA; and reviews of similar legislation in other countries. The Department’s assessment of the effectiveness of the legislation is that from the comments received, extensive research conducted, multiple engagements with various stakeholders and close analysis, RICA is, for the most part, workable and effective legislation but there are parts that require review. RICA is complex, difficult and policy-laden legislation. Its complexity stems from the fact that it brings together three substantive and weighty regulatory and policy considerations under one banner in interconnected, but separately managed, processes. An added layer of complexity is that this necessarily invokes consideration of privacy rights. In approaching a review of legislation of this complex nature, we must balance the duty of the state to respect the right to privacy and its obligation to protect national security and prevent crime. For this reason, benchmarking RICA is critical. RICA is one statute which is part of the broader justice and crime prevention machine, with links to privacy and data protection and SIM card regulation. It cannot be assessed or critiqued as a standalone solution to crime prevention and protection of national security. It is, and must be seen, as one part of the overarching solution to fight crime and protect national security. Some of these proposed solutions include tightening SIM card regulation processes throughout the SIM card value chain, introducing stricter controls for the issuance and delivery of SIM cards, strengthening and capacitating existing structures which facilitate the lawful interception of communication, and looking to international law and comparative foreign law for solutions which can be used in the South African context. Key to these proposed solutions is their viability in the current technological landscape, bearing in mind the socio-economic and legal impact of the solutions on the end-user and on those in the value chain. (2) The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) is mandated to prosecute offences as provided in Chapter 9 of the (Rica Act) after the South African Police Service (SAPS) has investigated such allegations. From the available statistics as provided in response to the Parliamentary Question number 935 of the Internal Question Paper: National Assembly no 11-2024, it is evident that over the past 7 years, 86 prosecutions of various offences contained in the RICA Act have led to the successful prosecution and conviction of 69 accused. The NPA does, not measure or record statistics of cases that were successfully prosecuted with the implementation of the provisions of the RICA Act, that enables certain evidence obtained by means of the RICA Act, to be used in criminal proceedings in order to prove the commission of various common and statutory offences. The NPA can however confirm that we receive applications in terms of Section 47(2), read with Sections 1, 5 and 47(1), of the RICA Act, to authorise the use of information regarding the commission of any criminal offence, obtained by means of any interception or the provision of any real-time or archived communication-related information obtained in terms of the said Act, or any similar Act in another country, as evidence in criminal proceedings or civil proceedings as contemplated in Chapter 5 or 6 of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act, No 121 of 1998. Such applications are therefore evident that the NPA does make use of the provisions of the RICA Act, to enable certain evidence obtained by means of the RICA Act, to be used in criminal proceedings to prove the commission of various common and statutory offences.',\n",

This means that the Department has very little room in its Compensation for Employees budget to pay for the hiring of additional staff. Where the Department has any critical, core, and scarce posts that are vacant due to natural attrition, these are filled through an open recruitment and selection process. The approach currently followed is for line function management to reprioritise the filling of only the most critical vacancies, by allocating funding to posts that have a high impact on service delivery. ---00O00--- DRAFT REPLY: RECOMMENDED/ NOT RECOMMENDED/ AMENDED DR SEAN PHILLIPS DIRECTOR-GENERAL DATE: DRAFT REPLY: APPROVED/ NOT APPROVED/ AMENDED MISS PEMMY C.P.

       "  'answer': '1. a) Undercount, which is a statistical term for persons missed during a census, is part of census undertaking as it is impossible to count all people in different countries throughout the world. Statistics South Africa (Stats SA) has led our country through four censuses since the dawn of democracy and has followed scientific rigour to adjust for any undercount during these censuses. Stats SA took proactive steps under the guidance of the Statistician-General to engage with the authors of the report in question — like we do with any other user — and explained the process followed when conducting the Census 2022, as well as the environment in which it took place to provide context. Census 2022, like any population enumeration the world over, is not without its own challenges. However, Stats SA was responsible for mitigating these through robust methodologies designed to ensure that the census stands the test of time. Our approach begins with the Post Enumeration Survey (PES), an independent sample survey conducted immediately after the census, aimed at identifying and correcting any undercounts or overcounts for different age cohorts, population groups, settlement types, etc. This process is fundamental in ensuring the accuracy of our population estimates. b) The undercount does not affect the use of census figures to be used for resource allocation because the undercount is adjusted for using methods of scientific rigour. Census 2022 is the result of meticulous statistical procedures, strict adherence to international standards, and thorough expert validation. This comprehensive undertaking serves as a crucial instrument for shaping evidence-based decision-making, policy development, and optimal resource distribution throughout South Africa. 2. a) I assure the public of our unwavering commitment to accuracy, transparency, and the continuous improvement of our statistical practices. The oversight provided by the South African Statistics Council and the evaluation done by experts — comprising both local and international — adds another layer of scrutiny to the Stats SA census process. These experts meticulously review our methodologies, including the PES outcomes, to assess whether the results are fit for their intended purpose. Their endorsement of Census 2022 as \"fit for purpose\" underscores the credibility and reliability of our statistical outputs. Council statement available in the public domain. b) Moreover, it is crucial to underscore that our statistical procedures are founded on international best practices as delineated in the United Nations Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics and, particularly for the census, the Principles and Recommendations for Population and Housing Censuses. These principles stipulate that our data must offer practical utility, be impartially disseminated, and adhere to scientific rigour in its collection and interpretation. c) It is imperative to assert definitively that the high undercount does not classify Census 2022 numbers as inaccurate. The final count was adjusted accordingly.

       "  'answer': \"The Master of the High Court plays a key role in overseeing the administration of deceased estates. Within this framework, the Master issues two types of appointments depending on the value of the estate. The first type of appointment is under Section 18(3) of the Administration of Estates Act 66 of 1965, which applies when the value of the deceased’s estate is less than R250,000. This process is less formal, as the Master’s representative is not required to provide a detailed account of the estate’s administration. However, these cases often involve family disputes. Even if the estate is under R250,000, the Master has the discretion to appoint a formal executor, requiring adherence to the formal procedures outlined in the Act. The second type of appointment is the issuing of Letters of Executorship in terms of Sections 13 and 14 of the same Act, applicable when the estate's value exceeds R250,000. These estates are subject to stricter legal requirements, including the submission of an account detailing the assets and liabilities of the deceased. The executor must also place advertisements and, within six months of appointment, submit a liquidation and distribution account, specifying the handling of the estate and its beneficiaries. Since the legal requirements can be complex and difficult for the lay person to navigate, executors often seek assistance from professionals such as attorneys, chartered accountants, fiduciary practitioners, or trust companies that specialise in estate administration. The Master’s office, due to its oversight role, cannot assist with the actual administration but rather focuses on resolving disputes or objections raised by heirs. While the Act prescribes a fee of 3.5% for these services, clients can negotiate lower fees with their legal or fiduciary practitioners.\",\n",

       "  'question': 'With reference to initiation season that has over the years been overshadowed by deaths of initiates and news of bogus traditional surgeons, and noting that the Eastern Cape reported the highest number of deaths year after year with 12 initiates having lost their lives in July 2024, what has his department identified as a strategy to attain a zero-deaths scenario as far as the death of initiates are concerned?',\n",
       "  'answer': 'The Customary Initiation Act was promulgated as the main intervention to attain zero deaths from customary initiation. The Act outlines the different role players and their responsibilities. At a provincial level, the Act provides that the Provincial Initiation Coordinating Committees (PICCs) and relevant Provincial Departments are the legal authority at provincial level for customary initiation practices. They are both charged with the responsibility of ensuring that all relevant provincial role players implement and comply with the Act. We believe that full compliance with and implementation of the health and safety standards provided for in the Act by all customary initiation provincial role players can prevent the initiation casualties. Therefore, the Department’s strategy includes: Strengthening the Functionality of the Provincial Initiation Coordinating Committees and Coordinating their resourcing: According to the Customary Initiation Act, the PICCs are the statutory structures to address all customary initiation-related issues in their respective Provinces. Their functionality will therefore contribute immensely to zero customary initiation deaths. Part of the Department’s strategy is therefore to legally strengthen the functionality of the PICCs by drafting the Customary Initiation Regulations. Furthermore, the Department will facilitate the provision of resources to the PICCs by relevant provincial Departments. PICCs Workshops on their statutory roles and those of other provincial role players: Convene workshops for the Eastern Cape PICC and all the other PICCs together with the relevant Provincial Departments in order to capacitate them on the provisions of the Act in respect of their statutory roles and those of traditional leaders, principals of customary initiation schools, traditional surgeons, caregivers, parents, customary and legal guardians and potential initiates. These workshops will ensure that all provincial role players, as well as parents and potential initiates will adhere to the health and safety standards provided for in the Act. Conduct Customary Initiation Act Awareness Campaigns in Hotspot Districts/Areas Since customary initiation is a family matter, the Department has in the previous and current financial years conducted two awareness campaigns in the Eastern Cape OR Tambo District since it was a Hotspot District. Part of the strategy will include continuing with the awareness campaigns in hotspot Districts/Areas working together with the National Initiation Oversight Committee (NIOC), relevant PICCs, Provincial Departments and Municipalities targeting parents, caregivers, legal and customary guardians and potential initiates (learners in the Department of Basic Education schools) to encourage compliance with the Act. Furthermore, the awareness campaigns will target other role players, namely customary initiation principals, traditional surgeons and traditional leaders for them to also comply with the health and safety standards provided for in the Act and all the other provisions of the Act. Joint Operations of law enforcement agencies with PICCs in Hotspot Districts during each initiation season The Department has started and will continue engagements with the South African Police Service to work with the PICCs to increase the arrests for the customary initiation offences as a deterrent for those who contravene the Act. I am advised that the Department has requested the SAPS to issue a NATJOINT directive to the PROVJOINTS so that initiation crimes are attended to as part of the PROVJOINTS agenda. I am advised that the directive has already been issued. Facilitation of collaboration between the PICCs and traditional leadership In terms of the Act, traditional leaders must screen principals, traditional surgeons and caregivers of initiation school and submit a report thereof to the PICCs to use for registration of customary initiation schools using the criteria developed by the National House of Traditional and Khoi-San Leaders. Traditional leaders are also required by the Act to conduct inspections/visits to customary initiation schools in their areas of jurisdiction. Therefore, the Department’s strategy also includes mobilising Houses of Traditional and Khoi-San leaders to ensure that all traditional leaders perform these statutory roles, promote compliance with the Act by role players and support the PICCs in promoting safe initiation practices within their areas of jurisdiction.

       "  'answer': ' THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE: In South Africa, 82% of land is suitable for agriculture and 69% thereof is suitable for livestock production and wildlife and 13% is suitable for dry land agriculture. Communal livestock production activities take place in at least 17% of the land suitable for livestock production. The communal sector comprises at least 40% of the national livestock herd. The value addition that goes with feed lotting contributes to the production of sufficient products of high value to be exported to markets like Saudi Arabia which increases off take of livestock for slaughter to international markets. The rural communal farmers are able to supply the feed lotters with animals and obtain the much-needed cash injections for survival. The value adders are able to improve on the animals and, by so doing, further enhance job creation. The production of other products like leather and wool is also improved in the process, thus contributing to livelihoods and job creation such as wool shearing and tanning of skins and hides. Countries within the region of Saudi Arabia witness the quality of South African products and express interest for the same products thus further expanding the markets for South African livestock products.

       "  'answer': '1. There are common trends across the financial years that contributed towards the underspending of disaster grants by municipalities. (a) Some of the key reasons advanced by municipalities in the underspending of Municipal Grants in the (i) 2019/20, (ii) 2020/21, (iii) 2021/22, (iv) 2022/23 and (v) 2023/24 financial years include the following: Notable is that the under-expenditure has not been experienced within the Provincial Disaster Grant in the mentioned financial years. The Provincial Disaster Grant allocation was converted to augment the Municipal Disaster Grants as per the provision of the Division of Revenue Act. This was due to the scope and magnitude of the disaster impacts within the affected municipalities. 2. Yes, the grant performance including unspent funds by the grant recipients was regularly reported to the National Treasury and respective Provincial Treasuries by declaring the unspent portion of the conditional grant in the Annual Financial Statements (AFS) as required by the legislation. Based on the unspent funds, the organ of state submitted rollover requests to the National Treasury to receive the approval to continue with the implementation of the projects in the new financial year. Of importance is that the department motivates for the approval of rollover applications to the National Treasury in support of municipalities to ensure that the implementation of disaster interventions is completed. In case the rollover application for the organ of state was not approved by National Treasury, the portion of the unspent funds had to revert to the National Revenue Fund. End',\n",

On a monthly basis, the Department analyses and consolidates progress reports from departments. The progress reports outline achievements, gaps, challenges and areas of improvement across the six National Strategic Plan on GBVF Pillars. The reports are presented to various DG Clusters and FOSAD where GBVF is a agenda standing item. 6. These reports are used by the department as a tool to monitor, enforce accountability of Accounting Officers and afford them the opportunity to assess progress made by their respective departments in implementing their allocated NSP on GBVF targets and take necessary corrective measures. 7. The NSP on GBVF Annual Report produced by the department includes the score cards that further reflects the level of sector department performance across the 6 Pillars of the NSP on GBVF; and recommendations for implementation. 8. Areas of monitoring include detection rates; conviction rates; training of the police; dealing with backlogs; availability of victim friendly rooms and GBVF desks in police stations; establishment and functioning of Thuthuzela Care Centres and Khuseleka one stop centres; availability of shelters and interim housing, access to psychosocial supporting, functioning of the GBV Command Centre, alignment of courts to the regulations on sexual offences courts; online protection orders application and enabling legislative environment, including the SAPS Budget and expenditure for all provinces and for procurement of DNA kits. 9. Ensuring women’s safety and sense of security remains a primary focus for departments and various stakeholders. The department has collaborated to create a comprehensive GBVF prevention strategy. Current efforts are directed towards developing a monitoring and evaluation framework that addresses ground-level needs and context-specific challenges, necessitating social behaviour change programs. 10. The department has created 365-day communication plan to advance prevention efforts. Additionally, to strengthen this focus on prevention, the Department of Justice and Constitutional Development has developed a femicide prevention strategy, highlighting femicide as a rising form of GBV. 11.The Cabinet has endorsed treating GBVF as if it’s a pandemic. This approach aims to significantly enhance accountability and institutional mechanisms across all levels of government, leverage preferential procurement for GBVF prevention and poverty alleviation, and bolster the implementation of evidence-based programs. 12.The department will utilize data from the victims of crime survey to create profiles at the ward level and collaborate with local political and administrative stakeholders to develop programmatic interventions. These efforts aim to reach the smallest societal unit, the household. To make a significant impact, a whole-of-society approach is necessary, ensuring that GBVF becomes a household topic, and its normalization is denounced.

       "  'answer': '1. The Makhanda High Court ruled the applicant, Intercape Bus Company, did not prove beyond reasonable doubt that there was a wilful disregard andmala fidein the failure to strictly comply with the interim relief granted by the court previously. The court accepted that the South African Police Service (SAPS) had, at the very least, provided evidence to prove that the non-compliance as held by the court, was not wilful andmala fide. Notwithstanding the dispute relating to the substantial compliance with the interim relief, SAPS complied or, at the very least, ensured that there was substantial compliance with the order. The SAPS only suspended compliance with the order when an assessment was made that the situation had been normalised, as no incident of violence had been reported for a period of three [3] months, until the 6th of October 2023 when an incident took place where a bus of Intercape Bus Company was stoned. During the period that the situation had been normalized, the SAPS continued with its regular duties of visible policing in the affected areas. It is prudent to point out that the SAPS did not only have a particular obligation to comply with the interim relief as granted to the Intercape Bus Company, but also had a broader constitutional duty to render policing duties to the communities affected by crime in the identified hotspot areas. It should furthermore be noted that immediately upon the finding of contempt of court and in compliance with the contempt order, the National Commissioner issued strict operational directives to ensure compliance with the court order. The Provincial Commissioner called upon all affected District Commissioners to submit operational plans to ensure strict compliance with the interim relief and the court was advised accordingly. The SAPS respects its legislative obligations and the seriousness of the situation with the Intercape Bus Company, in the same manner as it is required to consider the need of all citizens’ constitutional right to policing. There was accordingly no need to take any steps against the National Commissioner or Provincial Commissioner in view of the court’s ruling that the non-compliance was not wilful and did not involve anymala fide. 2. There could not be any consequences for the former Minister, as the court did not make a finding of wilful disregard andmala fidewith regard to the implementation of the interim relief against the National Commissioner or the Provincial Commissioner.',\n",

       "  'answer': '(1) The Mpumalanga Provincial CoGTA and Treasury have collaborated to support the Victor Khanye Local Municipality to service their Rand Water Utility debt. The municipality agreed to the development and conclusion of a payment plan with Rand Water Utility, however, the municipality failed to honour the payment plan due to lack of budget. As a result, the province and Treasury continue to support the municipality to develop a credible revenue management strategy with view to improve revenue collection so that they service the Rand Water debt. (2) The following are reasons that that municipality is unable to service the water debt: The collection rate of the municipality is at 60% which is below the acceptable standards. The municipality is also facing challenges of ageing infrastructure which contributes to high water losses. In the 2023/24 financial year, the municipality recorded water losses of 58% compared to 60% in the 2022/23 audited financial year. Therefore, the low collection rate of billed revenue is a major contributor to the municipality’s inability to service the Rand Water debt. The Department through MISA has assisted the municipality to source funding through the Budget Facility for Infrastructure (BFI) grant funding from National Treasury to the value of R1.6 billion to address the ageing infrastructure and alleviate water and sanitation problems within the municipality.

       "  'question': 'Given the rising societal challenges and strained public resources, what (a) evidence can she provide to show that the current investment in early childhood development programmes leads to societal benefits and (b) strategies are in place to ensure that the specified benefits are indeed realised?',\n",
       "  'answer': 'a)Global evidence consistently shows that investments in ECD offer a remarkable return, not only for individuals but for societies as a whole. At the individual level, quality ECD programmes are associated with a better transition to primary school, reduced repetition and drop-out rates and higher learning achievement in school (Heckman and Masterov 2007; Engle et al. 2011; Shafiq et al., 2018). Investments in children’s health and nutrition during their first 1,000 days yield better health outcomes throughout the lifetime. Across all types of ECD interventions, the benefits are more pronounced for children from poor households. Evidence from a range of settings also suggests that the cognitive and socio-emotional skills children develop in their early years are critical to success in the workplace and in life as adults, contributing to rising living standards of the entire population. At the societal level, the long-term benefits of investing in ECD established across countless studies, include reduced involvement in crime, better health-seeking behaviours and increased social cohesion and equality, all of which promote economic growth and reduce the burden on government systems (Garces, Thomas and Currie 2000; Heckman 2008a, 2008b, 2010; Heckman and Masterov 2007; Karoly et al. 1998; Schweinhart et al., 1993). These benefits also have implications beyond the individual’s lifetime in their potential to stop the intergenerational transmission of poverty (Gertler et al., 2021; Heckman and Karapakula, 2019). b) The Department of Basic Education developed, and started implementing\\xa0the 2030 Strategy for Early Learning Programmes. This Strategy will enable the South Africa to achieve universal access to quality ECD programmes, which in turn will enable increase job creation, micro-enterprise development, local economic development, and most importantly, establishing the foundations for children to thrive by five and ultimately to become economically productive citizens. Furthermore,\\xa0the Inter-Ministerial Committee on ECD, that was convened by the President in April 2024, agreed to track the progress on holistic child outcomes using an Outcomes-based monitoring framework. This framework will enable the various Department responsible for delivering services to children from conception to school-going age to track their progress on service delivery.',\n",

       "  'answer': \"NYP 2030 Monitoring and Evaluation Framework The Department of Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities (DWYPD) partnered with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) when developing a Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Framework for the National Youth Policy (NYP) 2020-2030. The M&E Framework ensures that implementing agents in the youth development space across public, private, and civil society sectors report progress on NYP pillars on quarterly basis against the set outcome and output indicators to ensure improved quality of life for the youth. This is intended to accelerate and track the successes and failures on youth development; identify challenges and implementation gaps; extract key lessons and best practices to be replicated and scaled up; and gather evidence to inform policy making and improved programme design. The data collected quarterly is compiled into the NYP implementation monitoring report, which entails analysis of progress made towards achieving the outcome and output indicators. Recommendations on what needs to be done to improve implementation are then made and the reports are tabled to the National Youth Machinery Forum (NYMF) for individual departments to receive feedback for their further responses. Various programmes that aim to ensure youth economic participation are monitored through the above machinery. Long NYP 2030 Monitoring and Evaluation Framework In order to accelerate youth empowerment and development, the Department of Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities (DWYPD), partnered with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) to develop a Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Framework for the National Youth Policy (NYP) 2020-2030. The framework was approved by Cabinet on 18 September 2022. The M&E framework ensures that, on quarterly basis, implementing agents in the youth development space across public, private, and civil society sectors, report on NYP priorities namely: The NYP is intended to ensure improved quality of life for the youth; standardized, and uniform reporting to measure the extent to which there is progress in advancing, among others, youth economic participation, job creation, and support to entrepreneurship. This is seen as the best way to track progress made on youth development; identify the challenges and implementation gaps; extract key lessons and best practices to be replicated and scaled up; and gather evidence to inform policy making and improve programme design. This framework was developed through extensive consultations with government departments at national, provincial and local levels, development partners as well civil society organisations. It builds on the strengths of existing data collection systems and ensures that all relevant information is collected through the use of one integrated tool. The process of collecting data will undoubtedly strengthen the integration and collaboration of the many sectors involved in youth development. It promotes greater accountability and ownership regarding the achievement of the National Youth Policy’s ambitious objectives of delivering on the five policy priorities. Data collected is compiled into the quarterly NYP implementation report. It is analysed to assess progress and make recommendations on what needs to be done to improve implementation. In addition to that, the DWYPD conducts desktop and documentary analysis of youth development interventions/ initiatives that target young people. To take the recommendations forward, the reports are tabled at the National Youth Machinery Forum (NYMF) to provide feedback to individual departments for management responses purpose. Youth Machinery Forums (YMFs) The DWYPD is responsible for the policy development and mainstreaming of youth development function, which includes ensuring policy coherence and alignment of plans and programmes with the National Youth Policy as well as applicable policies and legislation. As the custodian for youth development policy in the country, the department works with various stakeholders within and outside of government and utilises the Youth Machinery Forums (YMFs) to build collaboration and enhance monitoring of initiatives. The YMFs have been established at national, provincial, and local spheres of government to coordinate youth development within the country. The YMFs coordinate and integrate youth development initiatives, so that the youth can receive coordinated package of services. It is through these platforms that support and guidance is provided to stakeholders to ensure responsiveness to the challenges that young people are facing. Various programmes that aim to ensure youth economic participation are also monitored through the above machineries.

       "  'answer': '1. The Intergovernmental Relations Framework Act (IGRF), Act No. 13 of 2005 attempts to concretise the principles of co-operative governance in a general legislative framework applicable to all spheres and in all sectors of government. The IGRF Act provides for the establishment of the President’s Coordinating Council, Provincial and District Intergovernmental Forums.

       "  'answer': 'VIOLENT CRIMES AND GUN VIOLENCE IN SCHOOLS Considering that a 46-year-old teacher, Ms Dudu Khumalo, was fatally shot on 29 July 2024 at the Phikiswayo Primary School in Ntuzuma, KwaZulu-Natal, indicating that the escalation of violent crimes, including gun violence, has become alarmingly prevalent, what (a) steps have and/or will be taken to address the issue of safety in schools and (b) measures are being implemented to provide support and justice for the victims of such violence? The Department of Basic Education (DBE) and KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Provincial Education Department were highly distressed to hear about the senseless loss of Ms Dudu Khumalo’s life in the shooting at Phikiswayo Primary School on the 29th July 2024. As a department, there are a number of protocols and policies being actively implemented in schools to prevent this kind of violence and ensure that schools remain safe spaces that are weapon-free – it is concerning that despite these measures an incident of this nature has taken place. It is reported by Phikiswayo Primary school that one of their Grade R educators was fatally shot on the school premises by two unknown persons, who entered the school pretending to be parents of a grade R learner on the morning of the 29th July 2024. Upon hearing of this incident, the District Director, Circuit Managers and Special Needs Education Services (SNES) in KwaZulu-Natal were all dispatched to the school in question to provide support to those affected, and to the school. Additionally, School Safety and Security in the Pinetown District visited the school to ensure that all safety protocols as outlined in the NSSF were in place. They identified that the school was linked with the Ntuzuma Police Station (SAPS) via the SAPS protocol who are reported to have responded to the scene within minutes of the incident. In terms of carrying out an investigation into this incident and providing justice for the victim, the onus remains on law enforcement agencies such as SAPS to act swiftly, and to this end, a case has already been opened with the Ntuzuma Police Department (Case no. CAS 343/7/2024). In order to provide the school with the necessary support to get through this traumatic event, the department has deployed a Safety Officer to the school to assist with reinforcing current safety and security protocols, and a debriefing for both educators and learners was carried out with SNES. Additionally, the Department of Social Development and the Employee Assistant Programme deployed separate teams to the school to provide psychosocial support to learners and educators for 2 weeks following the incident. The victim’s family was also provided with support through transportation to their loved one’s memorial service, psychosocial support and trauma debriefing by a social worker provided by the department, facilitation of fast-tracking of the victim’s post-mortem, and assistance with funeral arrangements facilitated by the department in collaboration with the school and the victim’s family. The DBE continues to implement the National School Safety Framework\\xa0(NSSF),\\xa0which is a guiding framework in addressing all forms of violent incidences\\xa0in schools including gun violence. The NSSF empowers schools to identify and manage all safety threats in schools, establish school safety committees comprising of stakeholders such as teachers, police officers, school governing body members and learner representative council members. Furthermore, The NSSF also empowers schools to develop incident reporting mechanisms, establish collaborations with external stakeholders such as the South African Police Service (SAPS), the\\xa0Department of Social Development and civil society organisations,\\xa0develop school safety plans and policies to respond to safety challenges of violence in schools for both learners and educators. Through the implementation of the NSSF, access control measures in schools are strengthened\\xa0and awareness programmes by partner departments and civil society organisations are implemented in schools.\\xa0In this case, the Safety Officer deployed to the school has recommended that the school strengthen their access control policy and implement a “by appointment only” policy at the school so that the security guard may always be certain of the identity of visitors to the school. Currently, the school allows parents to come and go as they please, and this led to the criminals involved in this shooting to impersonate parents to gain access to the school premises. The Department also has an established Protocol with SAPS to address crime and violence in schools. The Protocol enables all schools to be linked to their local police stations, SAPS to conduct searches and seizures in schools and conduct crime awareness campaigns in schools. Searches and seizures aim to reduce violence in the schools (including gun violence) by confiscating contraband such as weapons, drugs, alcohol and other dangerous items to ensure that schools remain weapon and drug free zones. However, these searches and seizures are only conducted if there is reasonable suspicion of violence in the school. Regularly, schools further work with SAPS, local community police forums and social workers to address violent incidents such as gangsterism, bullying, drug abuse and the carrying of dangerous weapons in schools. It is evident that this protocol was well established at the school in question, and their linked SAPS station (Ntuzuma Police Station) responded to the incident rapidly, and opened a case as soon as possible, providing whatever support they could to the school. As the DBE, this incident will be followed up to ensure that Phikiswayo Primary School are able to move forward from this incident with appropriate support, and reinforcement of their safety protocols to ensure an incident like this does not occur in the school ever again, and educators and learners can feel safe within their school. The protocols and policies of the DBE will continue to be refined and implemented in schools across the country to prevent incidents of this nature from occurring in other schools, and to keep our children and educators safe, and keep our schools gun- and violence-free zones',\n",

       "  'answer': 'The DBE, in 2020 as part of the COVID recovery response, committed to a two (2) pronged programme which includes the\\xa0 Learning Recovery Programme and a Programme to Strengthen the Curriculum. For the purpose of this response, we will focus on the Curriculum Strengthening programme, which has as\\xa0its aim,\\xa0to equip our learners with competencies and skills for the future. Curriculum Strengthening\\xa0 is an umbrella programme that focus on 5 levers of change to improve learning outcomes. These levers are, the review and updating of the curriculum and assessment policy statement (CAPS), review and updating assessment practices to focus on learning, improve the capacity of\\xa0teachers to include active learning pedagogies, revise the learning and teaching support\\xa0 material (LTSM) toward improving the skills and competencies of our learners. Due to the centrality of the curriculum in this process, the work started with a focus on the curriculum policy and will gradually be extended towards other programmes. As a starting point, to improve alignment across the 5 levers,\\xa0\\xa0the DBE adopted the Basic Education competency framework, which outlines the priority skills and competencies to be prioritised across the 5 levers. In terms of the CAPS,\\xa0this\\xa0will result in the review and updating of the skills, knowledge, attitudes, character and values across all subjects and grades.\\xa0 In addition, a number of aligned activities are also taking place across the remaining levers.\\xa0 Currently the sector is developing an integrated 5 year plan for implementation during the tenure of the 7th administration.

       "  'question': 'Considering that the registration of non-profit organisations is taking too long, even though applicants had submitted all the relevant documentation timeously, what steps will her department take to fast-track the registration process?',\n",
       "  'answer': 'Registration of non-profit organisations are regulated in terms of section 12 and 13(2) of the Non-Profit Organisations which stipulates that organisations complying with section 13(1) must be registered within 2 months after receipt of the application. Registration applications are received online and through the post and walk ins. Upon receipt of the applications; they are captured into the NPO registration system, and an acknowledgement letter is emailed to the provided email address by the organisation. To comply with the turnaround time of two months as prescribed, the NPO registration system does countdown the time period for processing applications. As part of the process all applications are scrutinized to ascertain if they meet the requirement as prescribed in section 12 of the NPO Act. When organisations meet the NPO Act section 12 requirement they are informed via email of their registration status and the registration documents are send via email to organisations who have provided the department with the same. However; those applications that did not meet the NPO Act section 12 requirement; are duly informed and informed on how they can meet the requirement. Furthermore, section 13 of the General Laws Amendment Act of 2022, by the insertion of section 12(8), provides that an organisation that has submitted an application for registration is deemed to be registered unless and until the director has given notice to the applicant in terms of subsection (3) and the process envisaged in subsections (4) to (6) has been completed.

       "  'answer': '(a) Private laboratory services are either located within a private health establishment or in a separate location from a health establishment (laboratory depot). Private laboratories that are located in a private health establishment are regulated by the Office of Health Standards Compliance (OHSC). The OHSC requires that a Service Level Agreement (SLA) is entered into (between the private laboratory and the private health establishment) which includes service levels and turnaround times for the test results. The laboratory service provider must also provide the health establishment with a copy of the quality control audit done to confirm that the test results are indeed accurate and reliable Laboratory depots are currently unregulated by the OHSC however the OHSC will be developing norms and standards for such facilities. Private laboratories also voluntarily subject themselves to the South African National Accreditation System (SANAS) which assesses the standards applied by a laboratory against the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) which is another quality assurance measure. (b) Research laboratories would usually be part of a clinical trial and included in the trial protocol which would be approved by the trial scientific committee and the ethics committee. Both the scientific committee and ethics committee have a responsibility to ensure that the quality of laboratory tests is of an acceptable standard. Any breach in the standard of a research laboratory should be reported to the scientific committee and ethics committee since they are able to address the matter. Additionally, SAHPRA has a requirement that clinical trial research laboratories should be accredited by SANAS hence any non-adherence to standards and associated risk can also be reported to SAHPRA which also has oversight of the trial.

It should be noted that the Department is not aware to the concerns raised by the Auditor-General specifically on the use of Advisory Committees. 2. In relation to whether the DWS will continue to rely on the Advisory Committees; the position of the DWS is that the Advisory Committees have a specific focus area they are appointed for as and when needed. There is no reliance on Advisory Committees since because they are not a permanent feature. Once the task of the Advisory Committees are finalised, they are discontinued in line with legal contracts signed between the DWS and advisory committee members.

In terms of the Economic Regulator Commission, the concept behind it was always transitional (incubatory), in preparation for the envisaged Independent Economic Regulator. Now that the Department is moving towards possible establishment of the independent economic water regulator, the appropriate board will be appointed to lead all the effective execution of the economic regulatory functions. The Advisory Committee on the Middle Letaba water challenges, was established because the affected communities have, over the years, spurned the interventions by the Department, leading to the pursuance of an alternative solution by establishing an Independent investigative panel of water experts led by a reitred Judge. This panel is doing its work satisfactorily and is on course to deliver the report in line with the terms of reference (ratified by the affected communities) and the individual contracts.

There are allegations that members of UZETA did not want to be affiliates of the NTA or FELLDTA, as they want to remain affiliated to SANTACO. This division is also one of the main causes of the violence in Moletlane, Zebediela and Lebowakgomo areas. The SAPS and its law enforcement partners have also conducted regular multidisciplinary disruptive operations in the Zebediela and Lebowakgomo areas, in order to address illegal operations that fuel the conflict between the two leading taxi associations. Specialised capabilities, including Public Order Policing and the Tactical Response Team are deployed along routes between Lebowakgomo and Zebediela, to provide situational awareness, to maintain order, and to provide a specialised response to violent situations, if required. District members are deployed to patrol all taxi ranks and monitor the use of various routs by the respective taxi associations by means of vehicle check points and roadblocks, in cooperation with other law enforcement agencies.

The GBV Desks provide for the rendering of services by trained police officers and to prevent the secondary victimisation of individuals who report these crimes to the SAPS. All police stations have either dedicated, or designated, Victim Friendly Room (VFR), to provide privacy and dignity during engagements between SAPS members, and the victims of domestic violence and other GBV-related crimes. There are 1 166 police stations in the SAPS and 1 046 of these stations have dedicated VFRs, while the remaining 116 stations make use of an alternative room, as the stations do not have the facilities to dedicate a specific room for this purpose. The remaining four police stations, while established physically, are still in the process of being fully operationalised. A multi-year plan has been developed to prioritise the provisioning of VFRs to the 116 police stations, during the period 2024/25, to the 2028/29. Approximately 20 police stations will be prioritised, per financial year, over the next five financial years, for the establishment of dedicated VFRs. Training is provided to SAPS members that are stationed at police stations, on the following learning programmes, on an annual basis, in accordance with the SAPS’ annual Training Provisioning Programme, to ensure that the victims of domestic violence and GBV-related crimes are appropriately assisted by the SAPS: These learning programmes were incorporated into the Basic Police Development Learning Programme, in the 2022/23 financial year, to ensure that all new recruits are exposed to this training. The SAPS utilises National Instruction 7 of 1999, Domestic Violence, to guide police officials at police stations, in dealing with the domestic violence and GBV, as follows: The SAPS is fully cognisant of the fact that it cannot address domestic violence and GBV by acting alone, as these crimes take place in private spaces, between intimate partners. Putting an end to violent crimes and in particular, violent crimes against women and children, is not the responsibility of the SAPS alone, as this will require a “whole of government” and “whole of society approach”, as advocated by both the National Strategic Plan on Gender-based Violence and Femicide (NSP on GBV&F) and the Integrated Crime and Violence Prevention Strategy (ICVPS). The SAPS has developed a GBV&F Action Plan to drive the implementation of those elements of the NSP on GBV&F and the ICVPS, for which it is responsible, but also to promote an integrated approach through the active engagement of stakeholders.

       "  'answer': ' MINISTER OF WATER AND SANITATION The Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) monitors all the major dams and published the results on monthly basis. The Department of Water and Sanitation is also continuously updating the Reconciliation strategies/studies in relation to water requirements as well as supply and demand for the eight lager water supply systems of major economic importance. Various interventions to ensure water security are being implemented and monitored by Strategy Steering Committees, members of which include representatives of the DWS, provincial governments, municipalities, Catchment Management Agencies, water boards, Water User Associations and other water users. Information concerning the strategies is updated on a continuous basis. The Department has also launched the Gauteng Water Security Platform.The main purpose of the platform is to update and create awareness to the Gauteng community about the water resources and services situation within the Integrated Vaal River Systems (IVRS) which consists of 14 dams. The working group includes DWS, Rand Water, Johannesburg Water, Gauteng municipalities, experts, major water consumers, and civil society. The Department supports the establishment of Community Based Water and Sanitation Fora throughout the country to improve communication on water and sanitation related matters. These forums undergo capacity building and training to ensure sustainability and resilience of communities to climate change beyond project completion. Health and Hygiene Education and Water Conservation and Demand Management including water saving tips are part of the modules they are trained on. Catchment Management Forums (CMFs) have been established across the country to bring together a wide range of stakeholders involved in water and resource sanitation management (farmers, industries, Water services Authorities and community representatives). Meetings for the forums are convened on a quarterly basis, providing platforms for regular updates and discussions on critical water and sanitation services issues including, but not limited to Water Security and Water Conservation and Water Demand Management (WSWDM) and pollution of water resources. The Department runs ongoing awareness and communication campaigns to ensure that all water users understand the water related climate change issues and how to respond to them to ensure the limited available water resource is conserved, managed, controlled and used effectively, efficiently and sustainably. Awareness programmes are alsoextended to schools through the Department’s water and Sanitation Education Programme (WSEP). The WSEP is aimed at creating awareness on integrated water resources management and promote careers in the Water Sector. Communities and school communities are empowered about water use efficiency, management of toilet facilities, protection of water resources, health and hygiene for a healthy life and water safety. It engages learners and educators to various educational projects. During droughts, the Departments conduct urgent awareness to affected communities and targeted areas such as taxi ranks, airports and malls to alert communities of the drought and low levels of dams supplying the areas. Posters and leaflets on Water Conservation, leak detection and information on how to report leakages are shared. In addition to implementing the above, print media and radio slots are also be used to periodically remind the community members and stakeholders about water and sanitation management related messages and related tips.

       "  'answer': '(1)(a) The South African Police Service’s (SAPS) strategy forms part of the National Drug Master (NDM) Plan 2019/2024, which advocates a “whole of government approach”. The SAPS’ focus is predominantly on supply and demand reduction, which is addressed primarily through the following three approaches namely: disruption, dismantling and the neutralisation of drug use/abuse, dealers, groups and syndicates. The Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI) targets high-level and high-value targets and utilises a multi-disciplinary, integrated approach at national, regional and international levels. The focus is on the exchange of information and bi-lateral and joint operations, to target the drug supply chain, using a project- driven approach. Seven industrial-scale clandestine laboratories were dismantled, with 18 arrests, since 01 April 2024. The most notable was the Groblersdal laboratory, in which approximately R2 billion worth of methamphetamine, chemicals and equipment were seized. There were also significant successes of cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine, at various locations, including airports, sea ports and land borders, through this integrated approach. The DPCI also focuses on the proceeds of crime, guided by the Financial Action Task Force’s recommendations. This intense focus has resulted in significant assets (money, vehicles, property, yachts) recently having been forfeited to the state. (1)(b) Drug-trafficking is an ever-changing and evolving phenomenon, as is evident through the interchanging of manufacturing chemicals, new trafficking trends, including making use of the internet, the manufacturing of new types of designer drugs and new methods of cultivation and consumption. The SAPS is enhancing community awareness through targeted awareness campaigns on the dangers that drugs pose, as well as the importance of reporting drug-related crimes to the SAPS. Intelligence-driven operations and disruption operations are regularly carried out, with significant successes being achieved, on a daily basis. The SAPS’ Anti-Gang Units that are deployed within affected communities are further enhancing the SAPS’ capabilities to act against these crimes. To address the broader drug trade, the SAPS embarks on the following approaches to dismantle and neutralise these threats: The SAPS conducts the following types of investigations when dealing with drug trade in the communities. (2) The following capabilities are in place, to address the involvement of SAPS members, or other government officials, in allegations of drug-trafficking: The SAPS has a zero tolerance approach towards corruption. The SAPS receives complaints against SAPS members and government officials, which are investigated by the above-mentioned capabilities.',\n",

       "  'answer': '1. Let me make this one critical point first, a point I will keep on repeating. The unemployment nature in our country is deep-seated, systemic, structural and stubborn. So, when we look at the unemployment challenge in the country, it is always important to bear that in mind. Since the advent of democracy, the unemployment challenge has been one of the top priorities of government, as a result labour laws were formulated, policies were crafted, programmes were implemented and multiple strategies were employed in the previous Administrations. What this 7thAdministration is doing is the continuation of that work. But the focus now is more on collaborations, partnerships, cooperation and networking. We see collaboration, partnership, cooperation and networking starting with departments of government, different spheres of government, public entities, and private sector. Given the nature of the unemployment challenge that I have already characterised earlier, clearly this is not a matter of a single government department, the best that a line department can do is to coordinate the initiatives and interventions widely in the state and with private sector. That is our strategic direction. Taking it closer to the policy strategies of the department, a draft National Employment Policy is due for public consultations. Additionally, the department is in advanced stages of processing the National Labour Migration Policy and the Employment Services Amendment Bill that will soon be coming to Parliament. 2.

       "  'question': 'Given the widespread anger in Ekurhuleni over the water crisis and the impact of the six-months shutdown of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project, how will her department (a) address the infrastructure challenges of the Rand Water and (b) prevent a crisis similar to the electricity load shedding, while implementing measures to ensure a stable water supply, agriculture and food security in Gauteng?',\n",
       "  'answer': 'The water supply disruptions currently being experienced in Gauteng are caused by two inter-related factors. The demand for water in Gauteng continues to grow as a result of population growth and economic growth. There has also been an increase in non-revenue water in municipal systems, including illegal and unbilled connections as well as physical losses such as leaks from municipal water distribution systems. The leaks from municipal distribution systems are in turn the result of underbudgeting for infrastructure operation and maintenance by municipalities, which is partly caused by weak municipal billing and revenue collection for water services. In this context, the demand-supply relationship for treated water in Gauteng is very tight and the system is vulnerable to disruptions caused by spikes in demand during heatwaves, heavy load shedding, electro-mechanical breakdowns, or theft of metal parts of infrastructure. Secondly, due to a long period of instability in the national Department of Water and Sanitation, Phase Two of the R43 billion Lesotho Highlands Water Project (LHWP) (to provide additional water to Gauteng) was delayed. (a-b) Measures to resolve water supply challenges in Gauteng to be implemented by Gauteng municipalities and DWS include the following actions: Sector Actions Municipalities Department of Water and Sanitation Rand Water Board With regard to the impact of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project tunnel closure, during the shutdown of 2019 it was found that the steel liners in the tunnel urgently need extensive maintenance on both the RSA and Lesotho side. The maintenance process is estimated to take six months to complete. DWS conducted an analysis in May 2024 to assess the risk to the performance of the Integrated Vaal River System (IVRS) because of the tunnel closure, and to determine the impact of the shutdown on water availability to users in South Africa. The analysis confirmed that the impact of the outage on the overall IVRS will be insignificant considering that dams in the IVRS such as the Sterkfontein Dam and others are relatively full. This means that the closure of the tunnel for maintenance will not result in disruption of water supply to Rand Water, and to the municipalities in Gauteng and other provinces which are customers of Rand Water. Efforts are under way to mitigate the risks so that the shutdown does not have significant implications for domestic users along the Liebenbergsvlei River and its tributaries in the Free State during that period. During the tunnel shutdown, water will be released from the Saulspoort Dam which is situated on the Liebenbergsvlei River near Bethlehem. This dam will be filled to its capacity before the commencement of the shutdown period. This will ensure that the water requirements of towns along the Liebenbergsvlei River, including Bethlehem, Reitz, and Tweeling are sufficient for the duration of the tunnel shutdown. The water supply reliability will further be strengthened by municipalities drilling additional boreholes to supplement the supply in the event of unforeseen circumstances. The department is assisting the affected municipalities with Water Services Infrastructure Grants. The Minister has established a war room with the affected municipalities, that is meeting on a regular basis throughout the tunnel closure, to oversee the municipalities’ mitigation measures and to provide support where required. The MEC of COGTA in the Free State has also put together a technical task team to ensure that all the water users in the free state municipalities are not adversely affected and regular reports will be sent to Minister of Water and Sanitation. Licensed irrigators along the Liebenbergsvlei River and its tributaries will be issued with notices to restrict their abstraction during the shutdown period to certain days of the week, so that they abstract water from rivers fed by the Saulspoort Dam in a sustainable way during the tunnel closure. Abstraction of water from the river will be closely monitored by the Department during the closure to ensure that there is no illegal abstraction which might affect the ability of licensed irrigators to abstract the water which they require thereby ensuring food security during the closure period. ---00O00---',\n",

       "  'answer': \"There are two supply reservoirs that are operated by Rand Water, namely: the Vlakfontein and Benoni reservoirs which supply water to Tshwane, Mpumalanga and Ekurhuleni are dealt with separately in the response. The Vlakfontein reservoir supplies potable water to City of Ekurhuleni, including Etwatwa, City Tshwane, and the Thembisile Hani Local Municipality. Since the construction of the new Vlakfontein reservoir by Rand Water, Etwatwa, Daveyton and the surrounding areas have stabilised and are consistently receiving water. However, it should be noted that the stability of the reservoir is subject to the Vlakfontein reservoir being kept above 40%. If water levels at the Vlakfontein reservoir drop below 40%, then the Etwatwa reservoir and tower do not fill up and residents in Etwatwa do not get water. To address the problem, Rand Water commissioned a study to assess the infrastructure needs and the study, which was completed in May 2024, recommended as follows to both Rand Water and City of Ekurhuleni (CoE): INTERVENTION RESPONSIBLE INSTITUTION Construct new R6 pipeline 1500mm in diameter Rand Water Construct new Booster Pump Station just after the Daveyton Reservoirs and Tower Campus CoE Refurbish air valves from both RW and COE CoE and Rand Water Recommission the Combisa Pumpstation CoE When the challenges above are addressed, the Department will provide support during the implementation of the project, monitor progress and evaluate the impact of the solution on a regular basis. The Brakpan reservoir supplies Tsakane, KwaThema, and Langaville through a bulk meter in the City of Ekurhuleni. The CoE's distribution pipework consists of an 800mm internal diameter steel pipeline and a 450mm internal diameter cement pipeline, which extends from Brakpan to the City of Ekurhuleni's Zulu and Xhosa reservoirs. The municipality operates and maintains this distribution pipeline. The COE is in the process of upgrading the system's capacity to improve supply conditions at the end of the line in Tsakane through the construction of three additional reservoirs. Progress for the projects is at 80% completion. Once the reservoir and the distribution pipework are upgraded, Tsakane and surrounding areas would be able to obtain additional water using the normal Brakpan reservoir operating range. The Municipality will have to enter into new supply agreements since it is already exceeding its supply agreements limits. The water supply agreements between Rand Water and CoE is 813Ml/d. This target has been exceeded since October 2023. These actual figures are from Rand Water’s systems (from the Mapleton pump station, including Palmiet and Zwartkopies pump stations). Therefore, it is incorrect that CoE is not taking its full supply from Rand Water. The CoE is far exceeding the supply agreements with Rand water. ---00O00---\",\n",

       "  'answer': '(1) The Department’s intention with any public private partnership (PPPs) is to gain access to the funding and skills of the private sector to increase the provisioning of safe water, as well as to improve the reliability and efficiency of water provision further than it can do so by itself. Without the private sector, the Department’s ability is confined to the funds and capacity available within government only, which is insufficient to address the current needs. The constitution prohibits private ownership of water sources; thus all water belongs to the citizens of this country. As the custodian of all South Africa’s water resources, the Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) is responsible for regulating this environment through policy and laws to protect citizens. For instance, any water provider will need to be issued with a water use license, for which the Department can set conditions to protect abuse of the water resource. Also, the National Water Act informs the pricing strategy for water use charges, which the DWS implements in its private partnerships. Should DWS find that a private partner is abusing the access it has to a water source, it will be able to take appropriate regulatory steps. The DWS is also in the process of amending the Water Services Act, with the intention of professionalising the delivery of water services to ensure more reliable and efficient services. The amendments will require water service providers to be licensed. This will strengthen the Department’s regulatory role over all water service providers, whether private or public. Furthermore, the Department requires that feasibility studies of water schemes must take into account the affordability of the water by the communities it services. Before entering into a public private partnership, the Department requires proper preparation and structuring of the project. This will include an in-depth assessment of the affordability of tariffs to communities to ensure sustainable service delivery. The project preparation process includes a value for money element that ensures that no party takes undue risk or unduly benefits from a project. (2) There have been several studies which have looked at effective institutional models for water service delivery in challenged municipalities or areas. \\xa0This explored the role of private sector, industry, mining and communities as service providers, water services intermediaries, etc. Public private partnerships are not a new concept in the water sector and such projects have been implemented successfully in the past. Case studies exist demonstrating the successful implementation of water schemes through PPP models, such as BOT (Built-Operate-Transfer) or through the granting of concessions to private operators (one in Mbombela and another on the KZN coast). It must be reiterated that all private sector involvement in water services has been through public partnerships, and we have had no outright privatisation in South Africa. The DWS has explored many studies with its entities and partners as well as pilot studies building on past experiences. Below are few references, all available from the Water Research Commission’s website (www.wrc.org.za): Other institutions such as COGTA and National Treasury have also undertaken studies of this nature, and the research in this area is an ongoing process. The studies confirm that PPPs can go a long way to accelerate the provision of water services infrastructure and to address the gaps for which the government does not have sufficient funding or skills to fully address. But the studies also provide guidance on the implementation, based on lessons learned from past experiences. It is this research-based guidance that the DWS and the National Treasury incorporated into its processes when considering and implementing PPPs. The processes that government follows in preparation of each PPP by itself is a very thorough process that investigates all areas of the project, including the sustainability, value for money, and affordability. The process therefore also looks at the long-term impact of these projects on communities, municipalities, and government at large. DWS is in constant discussions with all role players, including the National Treasury to ensure that the provision of water to all communities are maintained and improved in a sustainable manner. The Department can therefore vouch for the success of PPPs entered into, with confidence that the long-term affordability is carefully considered through the extensive feasibility and project preparation process followed before any PPP is entered into. (3) As mentioned in the above responses, the Department is the custodian of water resources and is obliged to ensure fair allocation and distribution of water. It also strives to improve access to water services. The water services infrastructure gap currently far exceeds what the government can deliver with the skills available and within the fiscal constraints. Through PPPs, the DWS can facilitate more investment and skills in the water sector. Through extensive planning and project preparation studies, the Department will ensure that PPPs do not negatively affect rural communities on a case-by-case basis, but rather extend the reach of water services. Government is working actively to improve the framework within which partnerships are entered into with the private sector to ensure better services to all citizens in South Africa. ---00O00---',\n",

Paragraph (3) of the National Instruction indicates the following: If the 48-hours expire on a non-court-day, the accused must be taken to court before the end of the first court day thereafter. If the accused is however in transit from outside the jurisdiction of the court to within the jurisdiction, the 48-hours expire on the court day succeeding the day on which he or she came into the area of the jurisdiction of the court. The aforementioned National Instruction also regulates the duties of the various functionaries in a Community Services Centre with regard to the detention of a person who is to be detailed by the SAPS, including the recording of the arrival of an arrested person, at a police station, for the purposes of detention and the procedure that must be followed during the course of a person’s detention (3) There were no delays in informing the investigating officer of the arrest, as the accused was charged within the 48-hour time frame (4) Yes, as indicated at paragraph (2) above, all aspects of the detention management process are regulated by National Instruction 13 of 2019. In this instance, the required protocols were adhered by all of the SAPS members involved and no disciplinary action is, therefore, necessary.

       "  'answer': 'a)The Constitution assigns the responsibility of ensuring access to water and sanitation services to municipalities. The role of the national and provincial spheres of government is to support, monitor and regulate local government. The DWS as the regulator of the water sector is required to set national norms and standards for municipal water and sanitation services in terms of the Water Services Act. This responsibility includes monitoring compliance to the norms and standards and taking appropriate measures to correct and address non-compliance by municipalities which have the responsibility to provide clean water to communities. It is the responsibility of local government/municipalities to manage the infrastructure in their areas of services provision or supply. This must be implemented through their Infrastructure Asset Management Plans with planned and scheduled maintenance programmes, human resource capacity and financial resources. To support the municipalities, the Department administers the Regional Bulk Infrastructure Grant (RBIG) and Water Services Infrastructure Grant (WSIG), aimed at accelerating the delivery of clean water and sanitation facilities to communities that do not have access to basic water services. These grants account for an average of R14 billion per annum to support municipalities. The grant provides funding for various projects, including the construction of new infrastructure as well as refurbishment and extension of existing infrastructure. The department is currently also building its internal capacity to provide technical support to municipalities, as well as strengthening its water boards to assist municipalities. (b) To avert the issues of corruption or mismanagement of the grant funding, the grants have a direct and indirect component. In areas where municipalities have the capacity to implement projects themselves, funds are transferred directly to municipalities. In instances where the municipality does not have the capacity to implement projects, or where municipalities have a record of corruption or abuse of funds, the Department implements projects on behalf of municipalities through the indirect component of the grants. With indirect grants, the Department processes invoices per deliverable based on evidence that the deliverable has been achieved. When corruption is identified, the prescribed processes are followed, to engage law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute where there is evidence of wrong doing. Similar processes are followed at local government level as well. --00O00---',\n",

       "  'answer': 'The Water Services Authorities are required to develop corrective action plans (CAPs) in line with the outcome of the Green Drop report. In 2023 the Department conducted the Green Drop Progress Assessment which focuses on the wastewater treatment functionality. The assessment is conducted during the gap year of the full Green Drop assessment. The Green Drop Progress Assessment Report 2023 has indicated that overall, the national trend for wastewater systems has declined further with 76% of systems at high or critical risk category compared to 70% in 2022. The Department has collaborated with CoGTA, MISA and SALGA to support municipalities in the development of corrective action plans (CAPs). A template has been developed and provided to the municipalities as a guide for the development of the CAP. Where WSAs struggle to develop a CAP, the Department through its regional office, SALGA and MISA support the development process. WSAs are required to submit CAPs that are approved by their executives and to ensure that adequate resources are provided for the implementation of the CAP. CAPs that are submitted to the Department are evaluated and feedback is provided to municipalities. Implementation of the CAP is then monitored by the Department. ---00O00---',\n",

Rezoning is the legal process of changing the land use rights of a specific property from one form to another. The rezoning process is governed by the Municipal Planning Bylaw and the Spatial Planning and Land Use Management Act 16 of 2013 (SPLUMA), which set rules and restrictions that local government must abide by for land rezoning. Bylaws vary from municipality to municipality and are not always the same. These by-laws are often restrictive in that they overlook the fact that the human settlements grants already address some needs, including bulk provision, but they are inaccessible until the rezoning procedures are completed.

The State must take reasonable legislative and other measures, within its available resources, to achieve the progressive realization of this right. The starting point in addressing the housing crisis and affordable housing options in the country entails (1) ensuring the integrity of beneficiary management database through the digitisation process.

This levy is a domestic consumption tax that manufacturers in the Country are required to pay. Imported sugary beverages are also taxed when they are cleared for domestic consumption. The levy is administered and collected by SARS and is not within the mandate of the Department of Trade, Industry and Competition (the dtic).

       "  'answer': '(a),(b) The Department has not conducted an assessment on the productivity of land restored through various land reform programmes. However, in 2019 the Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development commissioned the Agricultural Research Council (ARC) and Intsika to conduct an assessment on 2 062 farms allocated under the Proactive Land Acquisition Strategy (PLAS). This study was designed to determine the assets verification and suitability, post-acquisition support and enable monitoring of progress of these farms. Although the study did not focus exclusively on productivity, the variables within the questionnaire triggered the response on the actual production status of the farms to provide a baseline performance statistic. The farms were then categorised as follows: Of the 2\\xa0062 farms that were assessed, 529 received support through the Recapitalisation and Development Programme (RADP). The assessment found that 132 farms (24%) operated at commercial level (11%) and medium scale (13%). 397 farms (76%) performed at livelihood level and the others were not productive. Generally, the assessment revealed that recapitalised farms performed slightly better than non-recapitalised farms.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'a)\\xa0A blocked project in the human settlements sector refers to an approved housing project that has been formally contracted and has initiated physical construction, but subsequently encounters a substantial delay (minimum of 12 months) and is not nearing completion (less than 95% complete). This definition encompasses various housing projects, including Community Residential Units (CRUs), Breaking New Ground (BNG) units, and serviced sites. Additionally, Social Housing projects, although not strictly classified as \"blocked,\" can also become stalled due to various factors such as financial unviability, building hijacking, maladministration, and rental boycotts, impacting their intended purpose and beneficiary occupancy. The total number of blocked and / or stalled projects across the Republic is263. This figure includes: b. Blocked BNG housing projects per province In 2022, we initiated a focused effort as the human settlements sector to address the backlog of blocked projects. The Housing Subsidy System (HSS) at that time identified 3445 such projects nationwide. Through collaborative efforts with provinces, which included direct consultations and workshops, we successfully unblocked a significant number of these projects. Of the 3445 blocked projects which were identified at the outset 3,150 projects were successfully unlocked. In 2023-2024 financial year, 70 projects were unblocked, leaving us with 225 blocked BNG housing projects. Provinces have planned to unblock 100 projects in the current financial year (2024-2025). The table below presents the number of blocked BNG housing projects in each province. However, due to the fluid nature of project implementation and the constant need of maintaining completely up to date data, the Department will be undertaking a verification process to review blocked projects on the ground. This process is essential to ensure data integrity and to gain a clear understanding of the current status of BNG projects across the country, as the number changes depending on the data available as at a particular reporting time. The verification will involve close collaboration with provincial authorities and may include site visits and detailed project reviews. NO PROVINCE NUMBER OF BLOCKED PROJECTS 1. EASTERN CAPE 46 2.

       "  'answer': \"a)(i)Specific action to address severe delays: The Snake Park development is a key project under the National Upgrading Support Programme (NUSP), initially projected to deliver 1,660 serviced stands over a multi-year timeline since the 2017/18 financial year. According to information from the Provincial Department of Human Settlements, all planning processes have received the necessary approvals from Sol Plaatje Municipality and the National Home Builders Registration Council (NHBRC). Despite the progress made in constructing the internal civil services, the project has encountered significant delays due to the unexpected discovery of an underground high-water table. This situation necessitated a reconfiguration of the delivery schedule, which had financial implications requiring further approvals. In response to the challenges, an expanded scope of work has been authorized, incorporating crucial elements such as the paving of 4.7 kilometers of access roads, the installation of V-drains for efficient storm-water management, and kerbing. To date, approximately 1,900 meters of paving, 3,200 meters of kerbing, and 450 meters of V-drains have been successfully completed. The project has been structured for phased implementation within the multi-year plan, guided by the readiness of each stage and the availability of necessary resources, including funding allocations. These factors have contributed to the delays, which are presently under review to facilitate and accelerate speedy completion. (ii) Specific action to address mismanagement Issues: The provincial department is conducting a thorough review of the existing project management protocols to identify any deficiencies contributing to mismanagement. This review will focus on improving planning, execution, and oversight processes to enhance overall project efficiency. The provincial department is also intending to implement a monitoring and accountability framework that includes regular progress assessments and performance reviews of contractors and project teams. It is expected that this framework will allow for real-time identification of issues and facilitate prompt corrective actions. Top of Form Bottom of Form b) How will the department ensure transparency and accountability in the financial reporting of the specified project and prevent further vandalism and theft of the infrastructure? The provincial department has a project steering committee (PSC), consisting of local stakeholders, convenes monthly to discuss and report on the project's progress. During construction, the developer, along with the appointed contractors, is responsible for safeguarding the infrastructure. Given the in-situ nature of the development, the local authority plays a crucial role in ensuring community safety and collaborating with local structures to mitigate risks related to vandalism and theft. To further enhance oversight, the province in partnership with the Housing Development Agency (HDA), is currently assessing the status of the infrastructure installed at the Snake Park Project. Following this assessment, the project will be prioritized for implementation in the next financial year, contingent upon funding availability. Moreover, the provincial department and the HDA will provide detailed monthly progress reports to the National Department of Human Settlements. These reports will outline specific and actionable mitigation measures aimed at preventing vandalism and theft of the infrastructure.\",\n",

       "  'answer': '(a)Employment numbers by firm size and proportion (Small Business Institute[1]): Size 2016 (Number of firms) 2016 (% of firms) 2016 (Number of employees) 2016 (% of employees) Micro 176333 0.66 685264 0.05 Small 68494 0.26 1548411 0.11 Medium 17397 0.06 1628429 0.12 Large 5735 0.02 9702416 0.72 (b)How Productivity SA is working with SMMEs to ensure that they create sustainable and long-term employment: Productivity SA works jointly with social partners and prioritises productivity growth programmes and interventions to improve long-term competitiveness and sustained inclusive growth to raise employment, reduce poverty and inequality. The organisation collaborates with Department of Trade, Industry and Competition (the dtic) and the Department of Small Business Development (DSBD) and their entities (SEDA, SEFA, IDC, NEF, etc). The focus of our interventions are on implementing policies and strategies (including Sector Master Plans, Special Economic Zone, Industrial Parks and District Development Model) to support sectors with long-term prospects; and turnaround strategies and plans to support enterprises and industries hard hit by the cyclical downturn. The focus of our interventions are on implementing policies and strategies including the Re-Imagined Industrial Strategy to improve the productivity of the priority sectors through the Sector Master Plans, Special Economic Zone, Industrial Parks and in support of the District Development Model), targeting the 44 Districts and 8 Metros; and turnaround strategies and plans to support enterprises and industries hard hit by the cyclical downturn and COVID-19 pandemic. We remain committed to leading a productivity driven agenda holistically across sectors and all levels (macro, sector/industry and micro) over the next six years of the remaining NDP 2030. Our conviction is that productivity is a crucial determinant and driver of long-term competitiveness and economic growth, and a vehicle towards prosperity and higher standards of living. Our resolve to promote a culture of productivity and accountability therefore remains, and we call upon government and social partners to join us in this journey. With this collaboration, we can collectively address the productivity and capability gaps of SMMEs – which is more critical than ever before for SA’s underperforming economy. SA’s SMMEs are facing a contracting economy and additional shocks from COVID-19 are putting further pressure on their operations. The lockdown measures have caused revenues in many SMMEs to fall and the majority reported that they are cutting back on business spending and scaling down operations to survive. Because of the SMMEs’ critical role in job creation and growth, creating a conducive environment for their competitiveness and sustainability during and beyond this period of economic turbulence is important for economic recovery. Productivity SA Enterprise Development and Support Programmes and performance during the 2023/24 Financial Year: Productivity SA uses its enterprise development and support programmes to promote productivity and competitiveness in South Africa. Productivity SA’s key enterprise development and support programmes are namely: the Business Turnaround and Recovery (BT&R) and the Competitiveness Improvement Services (CIS) Programmes. The programmes are designed to enable the entity to meet its commitments and plans to unlock South Africa’s productivity and potential for long-term competitiveness and sustained inclusive growth. The BT&R Programme focuses on supporting initiatives aimed at preventing job losses as well as providing for turnaround strategies to companies facing economic distress such as financial or operational difficulties which may result in an employer contemplating the dismissal of employees based on its operational requirements. The outcome of these interventions is to lessen the social and economic impact on individuals, companies, regions and the national economy. During the 2023/24 financial year, the BT&R Programme supported 71 enterprises, saved 5390 jobs and capacitated and trained 934 employees. The CIS Programme aims to enhance the capacities of SMMEs and Co-Operatives to adopt world-class productivity enhancement best practices whilst targeting priority productive sectors with strong growth and employment multipliers, with a strong focus on the township and rural economies. CIS interventions include capacity building of entrepreneurs and enterprises in both the formal and informal economy. One of the programmes under CIS is the Workplace Challenge (WPC) Programme which was introduced in 1998 by stakeholders in the National Economic Development and Labour Council (NEDLAC) under the auspices of the Department of Trade, Industry and Competition (the dtic). The WPC is funded by the dtic and implemented by Productivity SA. The programme was created to bring business, labour and government together to discuss and reach agreement on a set of arrangements and measures to improve the competitiveness and sustainability of enterprises and sectors, growth and increasingly higher levels of employment across all industrial sectors. During the 2023/24 financial year, 5195 SMMEs, Entrepreneurs, Workers and Managers as well as Productivity Champions were capacitated on productivity tools and trained on competitiveness improvement initiatives. A total of 102 of the enterprises supported were through the Workplace Challenge (WPC) Programme, funded by the dtic. 76% of the WPC businesses supported are Black owned businesses. 46% of the businesses have part or full women ownership and 19% of the businesses have part or full youth ownership. Over 3241 jobs were preserved through these interventions. Small Business Institute. 2018. “The number of formal micro, small & medium businesses in South Africa”. Accessed 13 September 2024.

       "  'answer': '  To this end, the Department has developed several policies and strategies and is currently implementing climate change adaptation and mitigation sector plans, programmes and strategies. These include the climate-smart agriculture strategic framework and climate change adaptation and mitigation sector plan to promote sustainable farming practices, create awareness of the impact of climate change, reduce agricultural emissions, and promote and increase the adaptative capacity of the sector by enhancing the resilience of all farmers, especially the under-resourced, small-scale and subsistence farmers. These categories of farmers are particularly vulnerable to the impact of climate change and, also safeguard national priorities such as food security in accordance with the sustainable development goals.  The Climate Change Act No. 22 of 2024 mandates sectors to put in place response measures to mitigate the impacts of climate change; hence my Department is planning to develop the greenhouse gas emissions reduction plan for the agriculture sector in line with the gazetted Draft Sectoral Emission Targets Report for public comment. These two documents will be aligned with the Climate Change Act, 2024.  Through the Conservation of Agricultural Resources Act No. 43 of 1983, and the Preservation and Development of Agricultural Land Bill passed by Parliament and awaiting assent, the Department will promote mitigation measures through regulatory interventions, which will enhance the optimal use of natural agricultural resources without degrading such resources. Other programmatic measures include soil, veld and climate long-term research projects within various agro-ecosystems of the country, promotion of the Landcare programme, demarcation of high potential agricultural land and the sharing of production practices that reduce reliance on fertiliser and increasing soil health and veld cover for increased production at reduced cost, thereby improving farmers livelihoods.  The Conservation Agriculture Policy is also one of the mitigation measures to address the principles of climate-smart agriculture. Through the application of conservation agriculture principles, an enabling environment will be created to not only increase productivity and efficiency on farms but will also curb production costs and mitigate threats to soil health, water quality and biodiversity.    Furthermore, an ecosystem approach to sustainable agriculture and land management is promoted and implemented.\\xa0 This approach is based on the practical application of the following locally adapted interlinked principles of:   Support provided includes the assessment of soil fertility and capacity building on soil health. Thus, best practises focusing on efficient fertiliser use with increased crop yield underlines any programmes and/or initiative that aims at promoting climate-resilient crops, water-efficient irrigation techniques, and soil conservation methods.  The Department is also currently implementing renewable energy programmes such as the crop-livestock integrated system wherein livestock manure is used to generate methane gas for cooking and lighting in their households. The project was implemented in KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo, Mpumalanga, Eastern Cape, and North West Provinces. This project aims to reduce methane from enteric fermentation. This project also assists subsistence farmers with rainwater harvesting techniques and promotes efficient water use through the drip irrigation technology. The project further assists subsistence farmers with shade nets for growing vegetables. The shade nets assist subsistence farmers to conserve moisture lost as a result of evaporation.  Other departmental climate change initiatives and programmes include the “Crop suitability to climate change: Agronomic performance of sorghum-based cropping systems in some smallholder farming areas of South Africa”. The long-term objective of this project is to assess the potential impact of climate change variables (rainfall, temperature) on the productivity of sorghum, both as a food crop and for bio-industrial processes in five provinces (North West, Limpopo, KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga and Free State). The expected outcomes of this research project include increased resilience and adaptation that are directly linked to climate change and the impact thereof on smallholder producers and to co-create solutions to challenges faced, improve sorghum production and enhance food and nutrition security. The implementation of the crop suitability to climate change programme promotes drought-resistant cultivars such as sorghum and follows on the successful crop suitability soyabean projects that were implemented in line with the other programmes such as Landcare, which incorporate conservation agriculture approaches.  (c) The implementation of cover crops within selected Landcare projects and on Agricultural Research Council (ARC) research farms is in process. The project is to establish ten (10) on-farm applied research as well as station basic research demonstrations covering cropping sites in seven provinces (KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape, Mpumalanga, Gauteng, Limpopo, Free State and North West). These demonstration sites will be used to introduce cover crops in smallholder farming systems for improved soil fertility, health, water conservation and adaptation to climate change. These sites will further be used to determine the effects of integrating crop and pasture-based livestock production systems on crop and livestock productivity amongst smallholder farmers. The sites are also earmarked for training purposes to provide smallholder farmers, Landcare officials, natural resources management scientists, practitioners, and extension officers with first-hand information/examples on the benefits of winter cover crops in a mixed farming system within different agro-ecological zones. The above-mentioned climate change initiatives and programmes are implemented in collaboration with the ARC, academic and research institutions, government stakeholders and role-players in South Africa.

       "  'answer': 'Working with the relevant government departments, the Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development (DALRRD) participated in negotiations to establish the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). This mega Free Tade Area (FTA) intends to open larger preferential market access for traded goods and services in the African continent. The Agreement covers, amongst others, trade in goods, services, investment, intellectual property rights and the competition policy. The fundamental objective of the AfCFTA is to create a duty-free single large regional market for traded goods and services with the goal to increase intra-Africa trade and deepen regional economic integration in the Continent. This large regional market comprises about 55 African countries. The Department participated in different critical areas of the AfCFTA negotiations such as the Sanitary and Phytosanitary measures, rules of origin, tariff negotiations (development of offers), industry workshops/ webinars and preparations for the commencement of trade. The Department further participated in the relevant implementation meetings (structures/Committees of the AfCFTA). As part of the AfCFTA market access, South Africa has identified Central Africa, Eastern Africa, North Africa and Western Africa as the regions with the greatest new trade potential for the country. The full implementation of the AfCFTA will result in the elimination of trade barriers and enable the sector to increase agricultural exports to regions beyond Southern Africa and eventually boost intra-Africa trade. Apart from the AfCFTA, the Department actively participated in the implementation meetings under the SACU Agreement and the SADC Free Trade Area with the view to advance and protect the interests of the sector. Through the effective implementation of these preferential trade Agreements, the sector has been able to increase agricultural exports and market share in the Southern African region.',\n",

       "  'answer': \"a) The process to amend the Municipal Finance Management Act, Act 56 of 2003 (MFMA) and the Public Finance Management Act, Act 1 of 1999 (PFMA) is at an advanced stage. It is anticipated that both Bills will be published for public comments before the end of the 2024/2025 financial year. In local government, the intention with the proposed amendments is to specifically incorporate the failure to comply with tax, duty, pension and other statutory commitments for financial reasons as one of the criteria for determining whether a particular municipality has a serious financial problem. This will assist National and provincial treasuries to determine whether a financial recovery plan is warranted, with the aim to assist the municipality to improve its financial affairs. For national and provincial departments, it is prevalent that late payment of invoices is triggered by factors, such as, cash blocking, high accruals from previous financial years, disputed invoices with suppliers, unresolved SCM-related challenges and other internal control deficiencies at departments. Treasury Regulation 8.2.3 provides that government must pay suppliers 30 days from receipt of an invoice. This requirement is applicable to departments, constitutional institutions and trading entities and the intention is to extend this requirement to public entities listed in Schedules 2 and 3 of the PFMA through the amendment of the PFMA. Additionally, matters relating to pension funds are specifically regulated by the Pensions Funds Act, 1956 (PFA). The PFA already includes enforcement measures to address the failure to pay deductions to pensions funds. Section 13A(1) of the PFA, requires the employer of any member of a pension fund to pay any contribution which in terms of the rules of the pension fund, is to be deducted from the member's remuneration, and any contribution for which the employer is liable in terms of the rules of the pension funds. Additionally, in terms of section 37(1)(a) of the PFA, any person who contravenes or fails to comply with section 13A of the PFA is guilty of an offence and liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding R10 million or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding 10 years or to both such fine and such imprisonment. The MFMA contains a similar obligation in section 65(2)(f) which requires accounting officers to ensure that all third-party statutory payments/commitments are made. Failure to do so will constitute an act of financial misconduct in terms of section 171 of the MFMA and the municipal council will have to process such an act in terms of the Municipal Regulations on Financial Misconduct Procedures and Criminal Proceedings. Therefore, the MFMA must be read together with the PFA in order to address the failure to pay contributions to the relevant pension fund. b) The relevant pension funds are required to submit information on defaulting municipalities to the Financial Sector Conduct Authority. National Treasury therefore relies on the list of defaulting employers as published by the Financial Sector Conduct Authority. The latest list published by the Financial Sector Conduct Authority on 26 March 2024, provides information as at 31 July 2023.\",\n",

       "  'answer': 'a)\\xa0Clinical signs of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) were detected on 30 April 2024 on a dairy farm in Humansdorp in the Eastern Cape province and a diagnosis of FMD was confirmed by the Onderstepoort Veterinary Research laboratory. Surveillance by clinical inspection and testing of animals were implemented to enable early detection of disease. All farms where suspicious lesions were seen in cattle, or where contact with positive animals could be established, were placed under quarantine with strict movement control, census of animals and individual identification of animals. Animals were sampled to determine the disease status of these farms. Cattle on 33 farms have tested positive for the disease. Cattle on these positive farms have been vaccinated without delay to decrease the viral load and to control the severity of the clinical signs seen especially in dairy cattle. Despite efforts to implement biosecurity measures on the farms, the disease continued to spread in the area and to adjacent properties. Requests were received to pre-emptively vaccinate dairy cattle on farms that have not been confirmed as being FMD-positive but were perceived to be at high risk of infection. Permission was granted to pre-emptively vaccinate cattle on 36 farms. b) To prevent further spreading of the disease beyond the affected area, the Department declared a Disease Management Area (DMA), which includes parts of the Kouga and Kou-Kamma Municipalities. The DMA makes it possible to control the movements of animals out of, into and within the affected area. The main aim of the DMA is to prevent the outward spread of the outbreaks, to areas not previously affected. In addition, the DMA aims to decrease the further spread of the disease within the affected area, as this will decrease the viral load and infection pressure in the area. No cloven-hoofed animals, animal products derived from cloven-hoofed animals or genetic material of cloven-hoofed animals may be moved from, to, or within the DMA except under the authority of a state veterinary permit and in compliance with the conditions of such permit. Intensive surveillance in and around the affected areas is ongoing.',\n",

       "  'question': 'What is the plan and/or strategy for investing in training and equipping farmers for the purpose of adapting to technological farming methods?',\n",
       "  'answer': \"The Department uses one of the pillars of the Comprehensive Agricultural Support Programme (CASP) dedicated to Training and Capacity Building of farmers. 10% of the total CASP budget is ringfenced for various capacity building interventions. Training provided to farmers ranges from technical, production, business and entrepreneurship, as well as Occupational, Health and Safety. Technological farming methods are handled as part of the technical training component. The specific aspects of training to be provided to farmers are identified through a skills audit conducted in provinces before training commences. The Department also uses the LandCare Programme principle, which are Government, Community, individual capacity through targeted training, education, and support mechanisms. Training needs are received through conducting skills audits which result in skills audit reports and training plans. The Department further uses the LandCare Programme Business Plan Development Guideline to build capacity of beneficiaries and farmers to adopt sustainable food production technologies. The guideline indicates that 10% of the overall provincial conditional grant must be allocated to capacity building. The Agricultural Research Council (ARC) as an entity of the Department, has an approvedstrategy for training and supporting farmers and other agricultural value chain actors. The strategy is implemented through several training and capacity development programmes, some of which are implemented with the Provincial, Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development (DALRRD), NGOs and industry. The Department uses research projects in partnership with the Agricultural Research Council (ARC) to build capacity of farmers planting cover crops, Conservation Agriculture mechanisation training and training on the use of spectroscopy for soil analysis. Training, capacity building and awareness on research projects conducted by ARC includes training of officials in both National and Provincial Departments of Agriculture, Farmers and communities are involved in training on the identification of problematic plant species which are declared in terms of Conservation of Agriculture Resources Act CARA, Act No. 43 of 1983, control and monitoring of the spread of such plants and dissemination of information to broader community members with an aim to curb the spread and reduce impact on natural agricultural resources to ensure food security. In 2023, the Department initiated a project in collaboration with the Agricultural Research Council to undertake the promotion of irrigation scheduling tools. Three provinces were selected for the pilot project i.e., Limpopo, KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) and North West. Irrigation scheduling is the process used by managers of irrigation systems to determine the correct frequency and duration of watering. There are however, many technologies available on the market. For this project, the Department selected the Chameleon and the Fullstop wetting front detector as the Department was involved in the research undertaken by the Water Research Commission (WRC) on these technologies. Training of farmers has been undertaken in Limpopo and recently in KZN on the use of irrigation scheduling tools. Farmers were then provided with the Chameleon and the Fullstop wetting front detector. The Department is in the process of monitoring the use of these technologies in Limpopo and North West and will be concluded in 2025. The ARC trains extension practitioners to have a multiplier effect for reaching farmers. These include the Climate Smart Agriculture training on strategies for farmers to mitigate against the effects of climate change and variability. Most ARC research programmes are designed with a developmental component that include farmer participation in research (through on-farm trials), peer learning, on-site demonstrations, and small enterprise development. Some of the notable work that ARC has done in this area includes potato and sweet potato production and agro-processing enterprise development. the intervention includes technical training and coaching on the production of value-added sweet potato and potato products e.g. yoghurts, flour, chips, jam and others. The national Kaonafatso ya Dikgomo (KYD) programme includes farmer training, support and disseminating information on new technologies for farmer adoption. The programme facilitates smallholder farmers' access to marketing channels such as auctions, sales yards and abattoirs. There are also programmes to facilitate the adoption of traditional (and indigenous), nutrition-dense, climate-resilient food crops by farmers as part of the food-based approach to reduce food insecurity. More recently the ARC and DALRRD have been conducting research to explore drone technology usage by small-scale farmers to assist with diagnosing challenges and context-driven technical solutions. ARC has developed several digital tools and applications to assist farmers in identifying pests and diseases and guide spraying and planting advice etc. ARC organises farmer field days and cultivar days to give farmers exposure and information on new technologies (cultivars, farming methods, implements etc). These events also serve to inform the ARC’s research agenda. ARC is involved in niche crops and leads the work on Cannabis through technical advice and value addition for product development.\",\n",

       "  'answer': 'The BMA is resolute in clamping down on corruption and applying strict disciplinary measures to officials who are found to have participated or aided the illegal movement of foreign nationals in the Republic. The additional number of Border Guards (400) who were deployed to the vulnerable segments of the borderline and ports of entry are assisting in reducing the number of corrupt activities and the harbouring of illegal foreigners. Since the inception of the BMA, the current statistical view of disciplinary cases that were processed is as follows:  The BMA further plans to collaborate with various anti-corruption agencies to clamp down on corrupt activities at the identified problematic ports of entry and the border law enforcement area through directed interventions. The full rollout of the Biometric Movement Control System (BMCS) and the design and deployment of passport stamps with enhanced security features at all the 71 ports of entry (both processes are currently underway) will reduce instances of fraud and corruption at South Africa’s ports of entry. The establishment of the Border Management and Immigration Anti-Corruption Forum which is constituted by the Special Investigation Unit (SIU), Border Management Authority and the Department of Home Affairs will also assist in developing strategies and measures aimed at dealing with corruption within the Border Management and Immigration space in general. The National Targeting Centre will be capacitated with skilled officials who will be able to gather enough intelligence and point to the areas where these corrupt incidents are taking place. The drones’ deployment and operations will be managed from this centre which is independent from the port of entry activities. Anti-Fraud corruption members in this unit will work hand-in-glove with other law enforcement agencies to pounce on corrupt port of entry officials. The BMA’s efforts to combat fraud and corruption at ports of entry and the borderline will be augmented by anti-smuggling activities. A long-term multi-disciplinary plan is being developed to address the smuggling of illegal migrants into South Africa and to neutralise human smuggling syndicates at ports of entry and the borderline.

       "  'answer': 'Recommendation Theme Key interventions implemented and gaps addressed Implement new Operating Model The review of the organisational structure has addressed challenges relating to the balance of power and strengthened risk governance, by reinstating key positions; including the Chief Investment Officer (CIO), Chief Technology Officer (CTO), Chief Operating Officer (COO) and Chief Risk Officer (CRO) alongside those of CEO (Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO). The CEO, CIO and CFO are also Ex-Officio Board members. The CIO is responsible for implementation of the investment strategy while the CEO, as the Accounting Officer, is accountable for overall performance and operations of the organisation. The Memorandum of Incorporation (MOI) was reviewed and aligned with the PIC Act, as amended (Public Investment Corporation Amendment, Act 14 of 2019). Governance The Board Charter and MOI address the governance issues relating to responsibilities of the Board, its committees, (terms of Reference) (ToR), caliber and credibility of directors, tenor of non-executive directors, Board induction, etc. Risk oversight and governance has been strengthened by separating the Audit Committee from the Risk Committee. The Board was appointed by the Minister, in consultation with Cabinet, and in accordance with the PIC Act, 2004, as amended, effective 1 November 2021. The Board also gives effect to the PIC Amendment Act, where the Minister had due regard to the Amendment Act, which states that the non-executive members must include: Independent Experts were also appointed for use by the Board members, as well as for the different Investment Committees. Quarterly meetings which were established between the PIC and key stakeholders such as the SARB, FSCA and large clients have helped to restore trust and confidence in the PIC, and to mitigate reputational risks. All client mandates are also approved by the FSCA. Meetings with clients take place at different management- and Board and Board committee levels. PIC submits a report reflecting all investments (both listed and unlisted) of deposits, to the Minister for tabling with the annual report and publishes it on its website in line with subsection (3) of the PIC Amendment Act. This ensures transparency and eliminates room for impropriety, by making information on investment decisions readily available. These investments are also disclosed in the Annual Report of the GEPF, which is available on the GEPF’s website. The governance structures of the Investment Committees were recently amended and now includes the following: The same approach was taken at Management level, with the following Committees: All minutes of Board and Committee meetings as well as Management meetings, reflect discussions that led to decisions and dissenting views are captured, and all resolutions are recorded. This ensures appropriate record keeping and that decisions are correctly implemented by the investment teams. All recommendations made by the Mpati Commission that needed further forensic investigations, have been completed and where required, matters were referred to the relevant law enforcement agencies including the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigations (the Hawks) and the FSCA. Review of internal processes Investment Mandate and Rest-of-Africa Investment Strategies were reviewed and approved in April 2022. A Conditions Precedent checklist is included as an Annexure to the Disbursement memorandum for each transaction. This ensures that investment decisions, as approved in the governance process, are implemented in the actual transaction, prior to funds being disbursed. A portal for investment submissions has been implemented to ensure a single-entry channel, in order to prevent any proposals from being advantaged. All new transactions are submitted to the Deal Screening Committee, therefore, all Fund Principals know which transactions the team is working on, that ensures there are no parallel processes on the same transaction. All transactions are subject to independent reports by the Risk-, Legal-, ESG-, and Finance Divisions, and all transactions go through all the relevant governance structures in terms of the Delegations of Authority. The Ethics Office and Ethics Management Structure was recommended by the Board and implemented under the supervision of SETCO in December 2020 and is now fully integrated into the business of the PIC. Prior to Committee meetings, employees declare their Conflicts of Interest to the Company Secretariat. On an annual basis, all employees submit a detailed “Annual Declaration of Interests” document, accompanied by a sworn affidavit, to the Ethics Office for scrutiny and the necessary actions, where required. Valuations are performed on a regular basis, with that for loan instruments performed monthly, while equity instruments are valued quarterly. Annual valuations are performed by independent valuers and presented to the Audit Committee for recommendation to the PIC clients for final approval. The investment strategy is reviewed annually, and the CIO’s Office has been appropriately structured. Risk measurement is conducted by the Market Risk and Credit Risk teams and the risk reports are tabled at the Group Management Investment Committee and Group Investment Committee meetings, as well as the Board Risk Committee. Ethics The Social, Ethics and Transformation Committee (SETCO) is mandated by the Board to oversee the PIC’s ethics performance, governance documents and policies on ethics, as well as ethics and reputational risks and corporate socially responsible investments (CSI). The Ethics Program, as detailed in the 2020 Ethics Strategy and Management plan, has been fully implemented. Between July and December 2023, a follow-up assessment was carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the already implemented ethics strategy actions, and to identify and address both new and existing ethical risks. The comprehensive results from the 2023 Ethics Risk Assessment (ERA) indicated a significant improvement. All recommendations from the results of the ethics surveys were implemented, and other areas of improvement have been addressed. The following Ethics related policies were amended, approved and implemented: These policies are published on the PIC Intranet, as is all other Policies and Standard Operating Procedures. Ethics Awareness Training has been rolled out to PIC staff and the Board. Induction training has been strengthened for new employees and/or Board members. Evaluating ethics and reputational risks has become an integral component of the investment due diligence process, and any transaction with the potential of an ethical risk, such as a reputational risk, are referred to the SETCO by the relevant Investment Committee. The PIC has a Whistle-Blowing hotline which is independent from the PIC and on an anonymous basis. Development / Review of policies All Policies/SOPs were reviewed and approved by the Board, and aligned with current laws, including Investment Policies. Maintenance reviews are done on a regular basis or when there are changes that necessitate a review. A Nominee Directors Policy was reviewed, enhanced, and approved by the Board. All nominations of Board members to the boards of investee companies are done by the Directors Affairs Committee, which is Chaired by the Chairperson of the Board and consists of the Chairpersons of all the other Board committees. An Information Classification policy was developed, approved, workshopped, and implemented. An integrated Talent and Succession Management Framework was approved by the Board of Directors in December 2023. In the 2022/23, the PIC Board adopted the PIC Transformation Charter. It provides the overarching principles for effecting transformation through the work the PIC does. It seeks to advance the PIC’s transformation agenda amongst investee companies and other stakeholders, to promote gender equality and the empowerment of women, under the Employment Equity Act, the application of the B-BBEE Act, and the Codes of Good Practice (as amended). Charter Objectives for Investee Companies: In terms of the Charter’s Objectives, Listed Investee Companies are required: Unlisted Investee Companies are required:',\n",

       "  'answer': '(a) Electricity theft and vandalism of infrastructure remain a huge concern in Eskom. Offenders continue to connect illegally on the network, bypassing meters, and tampering with electricity infrastructure, causing transformers to overload and explode. Eskom runs various awareness campaigns and educates its customers on different platforms about the consequences of electricity theft and the effects of infrastructure vandalism.Eskom remains committed to replacing these vandalised assets after investigations and audits are conducted and encourages communities to safeguard these assets and report acts of vandalism and theft of infrastructure.Further to combat theft and vandalism, Eskom frequently executes disconnections of tampered and illegally connected infrastructure. Eskom also conducts electricity meter audits and repairs where required. The rollout of smart meters is also ongoing and is part of the mitigation strategy. Eskom actively engages with law enforcement agencies and police when conducting audits on meters and electricity vending. There have been several arrests of individuals behind these kinds of wrongdoing.(b) The success behind these interventions is premised on community cooperation in allowing Eskom teams to construct and repair without any disturbances, promoting the legal use of electricity and eradicating theft and vandalism within communities. There have been successful community cooperatives where Eskom worked with the communities and illegal activities were brought to the fore and collaboratively addressed. Eskom continues to be intentional and engages communities serviced because they are the ones affected by these criminal activities. Eskom urges communities to come on board to assist Eskom with ending electricity theft and vandalism.',\n",

       "  'question': 'With reference to concerns raised by the National Treasury about municipalities that are underspending their conditional grants, what (a) has he found to be the causes of the underspending in the face of dire need and (b) steps does he intend to take to equip municipalities to effectively utilise their conditional grants?',\n",
       "  'answer': 'a) There are 10 infrastructural conditional grants allocated directly to local government of which the Department of Cooperative Governance administers 4 of these conditional grants to the value of R60,9 billion over the 2024 MTEF, which is 39% of the total Infrastructural Conditional Grants over the 2024 MTEF. In terms of the MIG, 42 perennial underperformance municipalities have been identified out of the 217 MIG receiving municipalities. On average these municipalities are spending below 80% of their MIG allocations over the last three years. However, the below causes can be regarded as general to all direct infrastructural conditional grants to municipalities. Causes for underspending on these direct conditional grants include: b) In light of the underlying principles of the DDM that require coordination and collaboration to deal with fragmentation in the conditional grant system, in March 2024 the Department revived the Municipal Infrastructure Task Team, with one of its core objectives being to coordinate and collaborate between stakeholders on various support interventions currently or to be operationalized. The Department in collaboration with relevant stakeholders continues to implement the Framework on Municipal Support and Intervention Plans (MSIPs) which are the intergovernmental support plans to address the short- and medium-term challenges in the key local government performance areas that includes service delivery. MSIPs for municipalities have been developed for struggling municipalities and multi-disciplinary teams have been deployed to support these municipalities. On ensuring that proper planning is applied, MISA is tasked with ensuring that all municipalities are referencing their conditional grant funded projects on existing infrastructure master plans so that they can be aligned to the needs of communities and be based on engineering principles. MISA has an infrastructure procurement office that reaches out to municipalities to assist with any procurement challenges. Furthermore, MISA have recently partnered with National Treasury on the PINK programme (Public Infrastructure Procurement and Knowledge Management) that seeks to engage municipalities that are experiencing procurement challenges with an intention to support, train and hand-on support to municipalities through navigating procurement for infrastructure. The programme is active for Free State and Mpumalanga municipalities and will be rolled-out across the country. MISA deploys technical experts in the field of Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Town Planning to low-capacity municipalities to provide technical support. In terms of the MIG conditions, municipalities are allowed to utilize up to 5% of their conditional Grant to augment the Project Management Capacity of the MIG allocations to support all schedule 5B direct grants to municipalities that includes the Regional Bulk Infrastructure Grant (RBIG) and Water Services Infrastructure Grant (WSIG).

       "  'answer': 'The Revenue Laws Amendment Act and Pension Funds Amendment Act were first published for public comment in June 2023 and went through two rounds of public comment/consultation. This was followed by further public hearings process through Parliament. To improve communication on the two-pot retirement system, the National Treasury worked with the Government Communication and Information Services to engage with government employees in the various departments. National Treasury also hosted a webinar with the media on the two-pot system, to ensure that the media is equipped with correct information for factual reporting and information dissemination. The National Treasury has also published on its website a Question-and-Answer document, and slides used during the information sessions on the two-pot retirement system. This document will be updated as the need arises. Media engagements in the form of radio, TV and Op-Ed were also had in various official languages. The Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA) and Government Employees Pension Fund (GEPF) have also conducted several webinars and information sharing sessions with union funds and GEPF members, respectively. Following the promulgation of the two-pot system legislation, the FSCA embarked on an awareness/educational campaign, targeted at trade union federations such as COSATU, FEDUSA and SAFTU. The FSCA also held in-person and/or virtual meetings with union funds shop-stewards for the message to filter down to the members. In addition, a brochure has been prepared and provided following these engagements. In addition, the FSCA will be monitoring the member education that is provided by funds and benefit administrators. It should be noted, however, that it remains the responsibility of the fund to educate members on the two-pot system pursuant to section 7D(1)(c) of the Pension Funds Act, 24 of 1956.',\n",

For the izimbizo held in 2023 about 12 broad categories of issues were raised and tracked which were similar to those emanating from the 2022 izimbizo. The integrated quarterly izimbizo outcomes tracking matrix and report tracks the implementation progress of all issues and commitments made during each imbizo, which includes service delivery matters and challenges. (b)(ii) The integrated quarterly izimbizo outcomes monitoring and tracking reports, which indicates that progress in addressing and responding to key service delivery matters are being made in all the provinces where izimbizo have been held. The consolidated report of April 2024 indicated the categories and geographical areas where progress relating to matters raised have not started or are either under progress or have been completed. 2. A key outcome of the Izimbizo is the development of outcomes and commitments action plans. These action plans are tracked by COGTA together with the Presidency, the DPME, and respective Offices of the Premier through an integrated quarterly izimbizo outcomes tracking matrix. Provincial Director Generals report on progress on these action plans quarterly at the quarterly national Governance, State Capacity and Institutional Development Cluster (GSCID).

The same Director General had reported to the GSCID in March 2024 on the previous Gauteng Imbizo. At the next GSCID cluster meeting the Director Generals for Mpumalanga and Northern Cape Provinces are expected to report on progress of the imbizo held in March and May 2024, in their respective provinces. 3. The integrated quarterly Izimbizo outcomes monitoring and tracking reports include progress reports and updates relating to Executive commitments.

       "  'answer': '1.\\xa0There is no conflict between any official of the Department of International Relations (DIRCO) and the African Commission on Nuclear Energy (AFCONE). In point of fact, the AFCONE, which consists of 12 elected members from amongst the States Parties to the Pelindaba Treaty, to which South Africa is also a member, has called upon and been extensively supported by the DIRCO official that is part of the AFCONE. This is as a result of the disciplinary action by the African Union Commission taken against the now dismissed Executive Secretary of the Secretariat of the AFCONE for gross misconduct. The former Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, the Hon. Dr Naledi Pandor, as well as the incumbent Hon. Ronald Lamola, have been fully briefed throughout the dispute process with the then suspended and now dismissed Executive Secretary, Mr E Agboraw. The Ministers were kept abreast of developments which spanned the investigation of misconduct allegations (concluded in December 2023 by the African Union Office of Internal Oversight) levelled against the dismissed Executive Secretary, his three month suspension period (12 March – 12 June 2024) which the Executive Secretary ignored and continued holding office contravening the conditions of his suspension, as well as the conclusion of his disciplinary process by an independent Disciplinary Board which resulted in his subsequent dismissal / termination of contract by the Chairperson of the African Union Commission with effect from 31 July 2024. The AFCONE and the Bureau of the Conference of States Parties have endorsed the decision of the Chairperson of the AUC to dismiss the Executive Secretary. 2. The diplomatic immunities and privileges of AFCONE have not been revoked and the operational capacity of the AFCONE in the Republic have not been affected by any action of South Africa in implementing the decision of the AUC. South Africa hosts the Secretariat of the AFCONE under a Host Country Agreement (HCA) signed between South Africa and the African Union (AU) in November 2015. Under the HCA, the Executive Secretary is granted diplomatic immunities and privileges under the Diplomatic Immunities and Privileges Act, No. 37 of 2001 as he is accredited in South Africa using an African Union Laissez Passer. Subsequent to the decision of the Chairperson of the African Union Commission, as the designating authority of the Executive Secretary, to terminate his employment contract on 30 July 2024, DIRCO was requested by the African Union Commission to implement the decision of the Chairperson of the African Union Commission by ceasing the immunities and privileges of the Executive Secretary which have been revoked by the African Union Commission Chairperson by virtue of his dismissal. DIRCO, in-line with its obligations under the HCA and the Diplomatic Immunities and Privileges Act, No. 37 of 2001 implemented the decision to revoke the Executive Secretary’s diplomatic immunities and privileges by issue of a Note Verbale, dated 22 August 2024 and 18 September 2024, as communicated by the Chairperson of the African Union Commission. Mr Agboraw brought an urgent application in the High Court of South Africa (Gauteng Division: Pretoria) against DIRCO regarding the withdrawal of his diplomatic immunities and privileges. Accordingly, judgement was delivered on 18 September 2024 with the court finding in favour of DIRCO, based on the lack of jurisdiction of South African courts not being competent to decide on the legality of Mr Agboraw’s termination of employment. Regarding the restoration of the dismissed Executive Secretary’s immunities and privileges, the judge noted that this is tied to the restoration of his employment, of which South African courts cannot determine the lawfulness. Subsequently, the court dismissed the matter, and to show its displeasure, the court considered it necessary to order Mr Agboraw to pay all the legal cost to DIRCO, associated with opposing his urgent application. With regard to the operational capacity of the Secretariat of AFCONE, it must be reiterated that this has been severely impacted by the misconduct of the dismissed Executive Secretary. South Africa remains fully committed to the Pelindaba Treaty and achieving its objectives, including the establishment of an effective, impartial and professional Secretariat of AFCONE that can execute its mandate in promoting the peaceful application of nuclear energy on the African Continent. South Africa will continue to work with all States Parties to the Pelindaba Treaty to prevent any further reputational, operational and financial damage to AFCONE and its Secretariat and to restore its credibility in the interest of the African Continent.',\n",

       "  'answer': 'South African Tourism is implementing the Sho’t Left Travel Week campaign. The campaign is aimed at encouraging the tourism trade to make affordable deals available for locals during Tourism Month. SA Tourism, in collaboration with the tourism trade partners, activated a campaign that produced over 600 travel deals, with discounts of up to 50% across all nine provinces. The campaign was promoted on TV, Radio, out-of-home, Digital, and Social Media. These deals were also promoted as part of Tourism Month to ensure that the Sho’t Left brand remains top of mind for the domestic market. Furthermore, to ensure coverage across villages and townships, the entity is collaborating with the South African Township and Villages Tourism Association (SATOVITO) to continue promoting Sho’t Left through their members and activations. The Department of Tourism informed that whilst it is not a marketing agency (South African Tourism is), the department is still responsible for awareness programs to increase knowledge of South Africans about the importance of Domestic Tourism, especially the poor and previously disadvantaged members of our communities. We have increased our visibility in the World Tourism Day host province, Northern Cape, and this includes the Launch of Tourism Month held on 20 August 2024; a public lecture on Astro-Tourism held on 13 September 2024; a visit to SKA on 26 September; and a joint hosting of World Tourism Day celebrations in Carnarvon. Surrounding communities have been invited through various local municipalities. With World Tourism Day celebrations taking place in Carnavon, the Department of Tourism finds the Kimberly Street Culture Festival relevant as it reflects our focus on the Northern Cape during Tourism Month. With Kimberly Street Culture Festival taking place on 27-28 September 2024, we are utilising the event to implement our Q2 target of Sports Tourism. There will be basketball, skateboarding, and soccer tournaments on the day, which will show how tourism and sports, plus other events, are intertwined. The program includes an education and awareness element that gives delegates a wholesome tourism experience. On the first day, a half-day information-sharing session is interactive and educational, covering the importance and relevance of domestic tourism. Delegates will be offered the practical experience of being tourists in their own backyard, attending the event, and later being transported to their respective places the following day. The plan is to mobilise through local government and relevant structures, hundred (100) delegates comprising of youth; local media; tourism/hospitality/developmental studies students from local tertiary institutions; organised groups, e.g. skateboard/basketball clubs as well as members from social tourism groups from neighbouring towns/villages in Kimberly.

The NDMC had for this period, implemented an APP project, through which 40 disaster management plans wereassessed.These plans were sourced from the 116 disaster management plans of municipalities submitted to the NDMC.Following the assessment, a report detailing areas requiring improvement is documented and shared with the respective municipalities who are the custodians of these disaster management plans. Disaster management plans are assessed to enhance the capacity of municipalities to implement their Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) strategies for climate protection. In 2023/24 and 2024/25, theAPP Indicator focused on “Number of municipalities in priority disaster areas implementing a disaster management strategy to prevent, prepare for and mitigate disaster risks in terms of the Disaster Management Act”.Through this process, the Disaster Management Implementation Monitoring Tool developed by the NDMC, was utilized to engage21 district municipalitiesto evaluate the extend at which they have developed and implemented DRR strategies within their geographic spaces. These constant engagements assist with awareness raising amongst municipalities, on the need to develop, enhance, review and update their disaster management plans that should also encompass disaster risk reduction (DRR) strategies to prevent, prepare and mitigate disaster risks for climate protection.

       "  'answer': 'The term of office for the Cultural and Creative Industries Federation of South Africa (CCIFSA) was set to conclude in August 2024. Under normal circumstances, this would lead to an elective conference aimed at selecting new office bearers. However, considering the recent consultations between the newly appointed Minister and various stakeholders in the sector, it has become increasingly apparent that more effective and impactful mechanisms are required for organising and representing the interests of the cultural and creative industries. The bosberaad convened in August 2024 provided significant insights into the limitations inherent in the configuration and mechanics of the previous structure of CCIFSA. These discussions emphasised the need for a more robust and representative body or cluster of bodies capable of addressing the diverse challenges faced by the sector. In response to these findings, further consultations are currently being undertaken to explore alternative organisational models that may better serve the needs of the industry. At this juncture, no definitive conclusion has been reached regarding the establishment of a new representative entity/ies. Once a suitable and viable model is identified, the Department will initiate the necessary processes to formally establish the new organisation(s) and ensure that all developments are communicated to the public and relevant oversight bodies in a transparent manner. The goal is to create a framework that not only addresses the current shortcomings but also fosters a more vibrant and sustainable cultural and creative sector in South Africa.',\n",

According to information from the Provincial Department of Human Settlements, all planning processes have received the necessary approvals from Sol Plaatje Municipality and the National Home Builders Registration Council (NHBRC). Despite the progress made in constructing the internal civil services, the project has encountered significant delays due to the unexpected discovery of an underground high-water table. This situation necessitated a reconfiguration of the delivery schedule, which had financial implications requiring further approvals. In response to the challenges, an expanded scope of work has been authorized, incorporating crucial elements such as the paving of 4.7 kilometers of access roads, the installation of V-drains for efficient storm-water management, and kerbing. To date, approximately 1,900 meters of paving, 3,200 meters of kerbing, and 450 meters of V-drains have been successfully completed. The project has been structured for phased implementation within the multi-year plan, guided by the readiness of each stage and the availability of necessary resources, including funding allocations. These factors have contributed to the delays, which are presently under review to facilitate and accelerate speedy completion. (ii) Specific action to address mismanagement Issues: The provincial department is conducting a thorough review of the existing project management protocols to identify any deficiencies contributing to mismanagement. This review will focus on improving planning, execution, and oversight processes to enhance overall project efficiency. The provincial department is also intending to implement a monitoring and accountability framework that includes regular progress assessments and performance reviews of contractors and project teams. It is expected that this framework will allow for real-time identification of issues and facilitate prompt corrective actions. Top of Form Bottom of Form b) How will the department ensure transparency and accountability in the financial reporting of the specified project and prevent further vandalism and theft of the infrastructure? The provincial department has a project steering committee (PSC), consisting of local stakeholders, convenes monthly to discuss and report on the project's progress. During construction, the developer, along with the appointed contractors, is responsible for safeguarding the infrastructure. Given the in-situ nature of the development, the local authority plays a crucial role in ensuring community safety and collaborating with local structures to mitigate risks related to vandalism and theft. To further enhance oversight, the province in partnership with the Housing Development Agency (HDA), is currently assessing the status of the infrastructure installed at the Snake Park Project. Following this assessment, the project will be prioritized for implementation in the next financial year, contingent upon funding availability. Moreover, the provincial department and the HDA will provide detailed monthly progress reports to the National Department of Human Settlements. These reports will outline specific and actionable mitigation measures aimed at preventing vandalism and theft of the infrastructure.\\nresponder: Minister of Human Settlements\\n\\ndate: 2024-10-03 00:00:00\\nmp: Marawu, Ms TL\\nquestion: (1) (a) What has she found to be the primary causes of the housing crisis in the Republic:\\n(2) What specific initiatives will her department launch to address the housing needs of low-income residents who are disproportionately affected by the housing crisis;\\n3) How does her department plan to simplify and streamline the current land zoning process to increase the availability of affordable housing;\\n(4) Whether her department plans to reform the land rezoning process to make it more efficient and responsive to community needs; if not, why not; if so, what (a) are the relevant details of the plans, (b) is the proposed timeline for implementation and (c) milestones have been put in place to indicate progress in addressing the housing crisis?\\nanswer: (1) (a) What has she found to be the primary causes of the housing crisis in the Republic: The primary causes in relation to land for human settlements development include (b) How does the current land rezoning process exacerbate the housing crisis. Rezoning is the legal process of changing the land use rights of a specific property from one form to another. The rezoning process is governed by the Municipal Planning Bylaw and the Spatial Planning and Land Use Management Act 16 of 2013 (SPLUMA), which set rules and restrictions that local government must abide by for land rezoning. Bylaws vary from municipality to municipality and are not always the same. These by-laws are often restrictive in that they overlook the fact that the human settlements grants already address some needs, including bulk provision, but they are inaccessible until the rezoning procedures are completed. Additionally, in the recent past, the instability observed in the municipalities results in delays in council resolutions, and/or tribunal authorisations. (c) What specific plans and concrete steps will her department take to (i) address the housing crisis and ii) increase affordable housing options Section 26 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 guarantees everyone a right of access to adequate housing123. The State must take reasonable legislative and other measures, within its available resources, to achieve the progressive realization of this right. The starting point in addressing the housing crisis and affordable housing options in the country entails (1) ensuring the integrity of beneficiary management database through the digitisation process. The credibility of the data will facilitate proper planning and allocation of limited resources to the bona-fide beneficiaries that are in need. (2) Enhancing and communicating the various human settlements products that caters for a wider range of beneficiaries, i.e. Social Housing and First Home Finance products for the gap market as well as rent-to-buy product development. (3) Finally, both the social housing and affordable housing stock shortage challenges will be addressed by partnerships with the private sector to stimulate investment in housing developments. (2) What specific initiatives will her department launch to address the housing needs of low-income residents who are disproportionately affected by the housing crisis; The Department plans to expedite the release of land for social housing projects, particularly within Restructuring Zones that have been designated for affordable rental housing and social housing. Efforts are being made to ensure land is ready for the development of serviced stands for low-income residents\\u200b. Additionally, rapid land release programmes aim to quickly release land to address housing need. (3) How does her department plan to simplify and streamline the current land zoning process to increase the availability of affordable housing; The Spatial Planning and Landuse Management Act 16 of 2013 (SPLUMA) grants municipalities the authority to make decisions on land use applications, including rezoning. The department is strengthening its intergovernmental relations efforts together with the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (CoGTA), South Africal Local Government Association (SALGA) and the Department Rural Development and Land Reform to find lasting solutions to the land rezoning challenges. (4) Whether her department plans to reform the land rezoning process to make it more efficient and responsive to community needs; if not, why not; if so, what (a) are the relevant details of the plans, (b) is the proposed timeline for implementation and (c) milestones have been put in place to indicate progress in addressing the housing crisis? The land rezoning process is governed by municipal by-laws and the the Spatial Planning and Landuse Management Act 16 of 2013 (SPLUMA). Local government is responsible for the implementation of its by-laws, whilst the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform is responsible for SPLUMA.
