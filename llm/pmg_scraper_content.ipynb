      "Answer: (a)(i) and (ii) What urgent steps have been taken to revive (i) rural tourism and (ii) and township tourism in the Republic (b) What key (i) strategies are in place that will be implemented to support and promote tourism in the specified areas? The strategy involves increasing geographic spread of visitors, the diversification of products and inclusive participation by communities. (b) What (ii) initiatives are in place that will be implemented to support and promote tourism in the specified areas? I am further informed by South African Tourism that In support of the rural and township areas, they have implemented the following programmes: The National Association Project is a key initiative undertaken by the SANCB to spread the regional distribution of business events to Villages, Townships and Small Dorpies (VTSD) across SA. The project aims to achieve the following outputs: – spreading the economic impact of local meetings and seminars to villages, towns and small dorpies (VTSDs); The Basic Qualification Verification (BQV) Programme, implemented by the TGCSA focuses specifically on support for homestays and other emerging tourism products in Villages, Townships, and Small Dorpies (VTSDs).
